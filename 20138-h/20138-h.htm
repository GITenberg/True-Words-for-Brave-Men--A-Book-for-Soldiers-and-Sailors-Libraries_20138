v</span>INTRODUCTORY NOTE.</h2>
<p>This little volume is selected from the unpublished sermons 
and addresses of Charles Kingsley by the request of a Colonel of 
Artillery, and with the sanction of an Army Chaplain of long 
experience, who knew the influence of his writings on soldiers, 
and who wish that that influence may live, though he is no longer
here.&nbsp; The Lecture on Cortez was given at Aldershot Camp in 
1858, and the Address to Brave Soldiers and Sailors written for 
and sent out to the troops before Sebastopol in the winter of 
1855, when Mr. Kingsley&rsquo;s own heart, with that of all 
England, was grieving over the sufferings of our noble army in 
the Crimea.&nbsp; F. E. K.</p>

1</span>I.&nbsp; THE GOOD CENTURION; OR, THE MAN UNDER 
AUTHORITY.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, 
there came unto Him a centurion, beseeching Him and saying, Lord,
my servant lieth at home, sick of the palsy, grievously 
tormented.&nbsp; And Jesus said unto him, I will come and heal 
him.&nbsp; The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy
that Thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, 
and my servant shall be healed.&nbsp; For I am a man under 
authority, having soldiers under me, and I say unto this man, Go,
and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my 
servant, Do this, and he doeth it.&nbsp; When Jesus heard it, he 
marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you,
I have not found such great faith, no, not in 
Israel.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Matt.</span> viii. 
5-10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We find in Holy Scripture, that of the seven heathens who were
first drawn to our Lord Jesus Christ and His gospel, three were 
soldiers.</p>
<p>The first was the Centurion, of whom our Lord speaks in such 
high terms of commendation.</p>
<p>The next, the Centurion who stood by His cross, and said, 
&ldquo;Truly this was the son of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Old legends 
say that his name was Longinus, and tell graceful tales of his 
after-life, which one would fain believe, if there were any 
evidence of their truth.</p>
<p><!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
2</span>The third, of course, was Cornelius, of whom we read in 
the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Now these three Centurions&mdash;commanding each a hundred 
men&mdash;had probably risen from the ranks; they were not highly
educated men; they had seen endless cruelty and immorality; they 
may have had, at times, to do ugly work themselves, in obedience 
to orders.&nbsp; They were doing, at the time when they are 
mentioned in Scripture, almost the worst work which a soldier can
do.&nbsp; For they were not defending their own country against 
foreign enemies.&nbsp; They were keeping down a conquered nation,
by a stern military despotism, in which the soldiery acted not 
merely as police, but as gaolers and executioners.&nbsp; And yet 
three men who had such work as this to do, are singled out in 
Scripture to become famous through all time, as the first-fruits 
of the heathen; and of one of them our Lord said, &ldquo;I have 
not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why is this?&nbsp; Was there anything in these soldiers&rsquo;
profession, in these soldiers&rsquo; training, which made them 
more ready than other men to acknowledge the Lord Jesus 
Christ?&nbsp; And if so; what was it?</p>
<p>Let us take the case of this first Centurion, and see if it 
will tell us.&nbsp; We will not invent any reasons of our own for
his great faith.&nbsp; We will let him give his own 
reasons.&nbsp; We will let him tell his own story.&nbsp; We may 
trust it; for our blessed Lord approved of it.&nbsp; Our Lord 
plainly thought that what the soldier had spoken, he had spoken 
well.&nbsp; And yet it is somewhat difficult to understand what 
was in his mind.&nbsp; He was plainly no talker; no orator.&nbsp;
Like many a good English soldier, sailor, yeoman, man of 
business, he had very sound instincts in him, and drew very sound
conclusions from them: but he could <!-- page 3--><a 
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>not put them 
into words.&nbsp; He knew that he was right, but he could not 
make a speech about it.&nbsp; Better that, than be&mdash;as too 
many are&mdash;ready to make glib speeches, which they only half 
believe themselves; ready to deceive themselves with subtle 
arguments and high-flown oratory, till they can give the most 
satisfactory reasons for doing the most unsatisfactory and 
unreasonable things.&nbsp; No, the good soldier was no orator: 
but he had sound sense under his clumsy words.&nbsp; Let us 
listen to them once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a man under authority, having soldiers under 
me.&nbsp; And I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to 
another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he 
doeth it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely the thought which was in his mind 
is to be found in the very words which he 
used&mdash;Authority.&nbsp; Subordination.&nbsp; 
Discipline.&nbsp; Obedience.&nbsp; He was under authority, and 
must obey his superior officer.&nbsp; He had soldiers under him, 
and they must obey him.&nbsp; There must be not only no mutiny, 
but no neglect, no arguing, no asking why.&nbsp; If he said Go, a
man must go; if he said Come, a man must come; and make no words 
about it.&nbsp; Otherwise the Emperor&rsquo;s service would go to
ruin, through laziness, distrust, and mutinous talk.&nbsp; By 
subordination, by discipline, by mutual trust and strict 
obedience, that empire of Rome was conquering the old world; 
because every Roman knew his place, and every Roman did what he 
was told.</p>
<p>But what had that to do with our Lord&rsquo;s power, and with 
the healing of the child?</p>
<p>This.&nbsp; The honest soldier had, I think, in his mind, that
subordination was one of the most necessary things in the world; 
that without it the world could not go on.&nbsp; <!-- page 4--><a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Then he said to
himself, &ldquo;If there must be subordination on earth, must 
there not be subordination in heaven?&rdquo;&nbsp; If he, a poor 
officer, could get his commands obeyed, by merely speaking the 
word; then how much more could God.&nbsp; If Jesus was&mdash;as 
He said&mdash;as His disciples said&mdash;the Lord, the God of 
the Jews: then He had no need to come and see a sick man; no need
to lay His hands on him; to perform ceremonies or say prayers 
over him.&nbsp; The Laws of Nature, by which health and sickness 
come, would obey His word of command without rebellion and 
without delay.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak the word only, Lord, and my 
servant shall be healed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how did the Centurion know&mdash;seemingly at first sight,
that Jesus was the Lord God?&nbsp; Ah, how indeed?</p>
<p>I think it was because he had learnt the soldier&rsquo;s 
lesson.&nbsp; He had seen many a valiant officer&mdash;Tribunes, 
Prefects, Consuls, Emperors, commanding men; and fit to command 
men.&nbsp; There was no lack of such men in the Roman empire 
then, as the poor, foolish, unruly Jews found out to their cost 
within the next forty years.&nbsp; And the good Centurion had 
been accustomed to look at such men; and to look up to them 
beside, and say not merely&mdash;It is a duty to obey these men, 
but&mdash;It is a delight to obey them.&nbsp; He had been 
accustomed&mdash;as it is good for every man to be 
accustomed&mdash;to meet men superior to himself; men able to 
guide and rule him.&nbsp; And he had learned&mdash;as every good 
soldier ought to learn&mdash;when he met such a man, not to envy 
him, not to backbite him, not to intrigue against him, not to try
to pull him down: but to accept him for what he was&mdash;a man 
who was to be followed, if need be, to the death.</p>
<p>There was in that good Centurion none of the base <!-- page 
5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>spirit 
of envy, which dreads and therefore hates excellence, hates 
ability, hates authority; the mutinous spirit which ends, 
not&mdash;as it dreams&mdash;in freedom and equality, but in 
slavery and tyranny; because it transforms a whole army&mdash;a 
whole nation&mdash;from what it should be, a pack of staunch and 
faithful hounds, into a mob of quarrelsome and greedy curs.&nbsp;
Not of that spirit was the good Centurion: but of the spirit of 
reverence and loyalty; the spirit which delights in, and looks up
to, all that is brave and able, great and good; the spirit of 
true independence, true freedom, and the true self-respect which 
respects its fellow men; and therefore it was, that when the 
Centurion came into the divine presence of Christ, he knew at 
once, instinctively and by a glance, into what a presence he had 
come.&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s mere countenance, Christ&rsquo;s mere 
bearing, I believe, told that good soldier who He was.&nbsp; He 
knew of old the look of great commanders: and now he saw a 
countenance, in spite of all its sweetness, more commanding than 
he had ever seen before.&nbsp; He knew of old the bearing of 
Consuls and of Emperors: and now, in spite of Christ&rsquo;s 
lowly disguise, he recognised the bearing of an Emperor of 
emperors, a King of kings.&nbsp; He had learnt of old to know a 
man when he met one; and now, he felt that he had met the Man of 
all men, the Son of Man; and that so God-like was His presence, 
that He must be likewise the Son of God.</p>
<p>And so had this good soldier his reward; his reward for the 
soldierly qualities which he had acquired; for subordination; for
reverence; for admiration of great and able men.&nbsp; And what 
was his reward?&nbsp; Not merely that his favourite servant was 
healed at his request: but that he learnt to know the Lord Jesus 
Christ, <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>whom truly to know is everlasting 
life; whom the selfish, the conceited, the envious, the 
slanderous, the insolent, the mutinous, know not, and never will 
know; for they are not of His Spirit, neither is He of 
theirs.</p>
<p>But more: What is the moral which old divines have drawn from 
this story?&nbsp; &ldquo;If you wish to govern: learn first to 
obey.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is a moral lesson more valuable than even
the use of arms.&nbsp; To learn&mdash;as the good Centurion 
learnt&mdash;that a free man can give up his independence without
losing it.&nbsp; Losing it?&nbsp; Independence is never more 
called out than by subordination.&nbsp; A man never feels himself
so much of a free man as when he is freely obeying those whom the
laws of his country have set over him.&nbsp; A man never feels so
able as when he is following the lead of an abler man than 
himself.&nbsp; Remember this.&nbsp; Make it a point of honour to 
do your duty earnestly, scrupulously, and to the uttermost; and 
you will find that the habits of self-restraint, discipline, and 
obedience, which you, as soldiers, have learned, will stand you 
in good stead for the rest of your lives, and make you each, in 
his place, fit to rule, just because you have learned to 
obey.</p>
<p>But now go on a step, as the good Centurion went on, and 
say&mdash;If there is no succeeding in earthly things, whether in
soldiering or any other profession, without subordination; 
without obeying rules and orders strictly and without question: 
then perhaps there is no succeeding in spiritual and heavenly 
things.&nbsp; For has not God His moral Laws, His spiritual Laws,
which must be obeyed, if you intend to prosper in this life, or 
in the life to come?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou <i>shalt</i> love the Lord thy God with all thy 
heart and soul, and thy neighbour as thyself.&nbsp; Thou 
<i>shalt</i> <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>honour thy father and thy 
mother.&nbsp; Thou <i>shalt not</i> kill, steal, commit adultery,
slander, or covet.&rdquo;&nbsp; So it is written: not merely on 
those old tables of stone on Sinai; but in The Eternal Will of 
God, and in the very nature of this world, which God has 
made.&nbsp; There is no escaping those Laws.&nbsp; They fulfil 
themselves.&nbsp; God says to them, &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; and they 
go; &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; and they come; &ldquo;Do justice on the 
offender,&rdquo; and they do it.&nbsp; If we are fools and 
disobey them, they will grind us to powder.&nbsp; If we are wise 
and obey them, they will reward us.&nbsp; For in wisdom&rsquo;s 
right hand is length of days, and in her left hand riches and 
honour.&nbsp; Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her 
paths are peace.&nbsp; She is a tree of life to them that lay 
hold of her, and blessed is every one that retaineth her; as God 
grant you all will do.</p>
<p>But you, too, in time may have soldiers under you.&nbsp; 
Think, I beseech you, earnestly of this, and for their sake, as 
well as for your own, try by God&rsquo;s help to live worthy of 
Christian English men.&nbsp; Let them see you going out and 
coming in, whether on duty or by your own firesides, as men who 
feel that they are &ldquo;ever beneath their great 
taskmaster&rsquo;s eye;&rdquo; who have a solemn duty to perform,
namely, the duty of living like good men toward your superior 
officers, your families, your neighbours, your country, and your 
God&mdash;even towards that Saviour who so loved you that He died
for you on the cross, to set you the example of what true men 
should be; the example of perfect duty, perfect obedience, 
perfect courage, perfect generosity&mdash;in one word&mdash;the 
example of a perfect Hero.</p>
<p>Live such lives, and then, will be fulfilled to you, and to 
your children after you, from generation to generation, the 
promises which God made, ages since, to the men of <!-- page 
8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Judea of
old; promises which are all true still, and will continue true, 
in every country of the world, till the world&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put thou thy trust in the Lord, and be doing good; 
dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</p>
<p>The Lord knoweth the doings of the righteous; and their 
inheritance shall endure for ever.</p>
<p>They shall not be confounded in the perilous time; and in the 
days of dearth they shall have enough.</p>
<p>The Lord ordereth a good man&rsquo;s going; and maketh his way
acceptable to himself.</p>
<p>Though he fall, he shall not be cast down; for the Lord 
upholdeth him with his hand.</p>
<p>I have been young, and now I am old; yet saw I never the 
righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread.</p>
<p>Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good; and dwell for 
evermore.</p>
<p>For the Lord loveth the thing that is right; He forsaketh not 
his that are godly, but they are preserved for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Amen.</p>
<h2><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
9</span>II.&nbsp; CHRIST IS COME.&nbsp; A CHRISTMAS SERMON.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son 
is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his 
name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The 
everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.&nbsp; Of the increase of
his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne 
of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it 
with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for 
ever.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> ix. 6, 
7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is now more than three thousand years ago that God made to 
Abraham the promise, &ldquo;In thy seed shall all the nations of 
the earth be blessed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again the promise was renewed 
to Moses when he was commanded to tell the Jews, &ldquo;a prophet
shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like unto me.&nbsp; 
Hear ye him . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; In David&rsquo;s Psalms, again, 
this same strange person was spoken of who was already, and yet 
who was to come.&nbsp; David calls him the Son of God, the King 
of kings.&nbsp; Again, in the Prophets, in many strange and 
mysterious words, is this same being spoken of as a 
virgin&rsquo;s child&mdash;&ldquo;Behold a virgin shall conceive 
and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel, God with 
us;&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;Unto us a child is born, unto us a 
son is given, and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor,
the <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
10</span>Mighty God&mdash;the Everlasting Father, the Prince of 
Peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, &ldquo;There shall come forth a 
rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his 
roots.&nbsp; And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon 
him,&mdash;the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of 
knowledge and the fear of the Lord.&nbsp; And with righteousness 
shall He judge the poor,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>And again, &ldquo;Thou Bethlehem, though thou be little among 
the princes of Judah, yet out of thee shall come forth He that is
to be ruler in Israel, whose goings forth have been from 
everlasting.&nbsp; And He shall be great unto the ends of the 
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But time would fail me if I tried to repeat to you half the 
passages wherein the old Jewish prophets foretold Him who was to 
come, and in whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed,
more and more clearly as the time drew nigh.</p>
<p>Well, my friends, surely you know of whom I have been 
speaking&mdash;of whom Moses and the prophets spoke&mdash;of Him 
who was born of a village maiden, laid in a manger, proclaimed of
angels to the shepherds, worshipped with hymns of glory by the 
heavenly host on the first Christmas day eighteen hundred and 
seventy-eight years ago, as we count time.&nbsp; Aye, strange as 
it may seem, <i>He is come</i>, and in Him all the nations of the
earth are blessed.&nbsp; <i>He is come</i>&mdash;the Conqueror of
Evil&mdash;the desire of all nations&mdash;the 
Law-giver&mdash;the Lamb which was to suffer for our 
sins&mdash;the King of kings&mdash;the Light which should lighten
the heathen&mdash;the Virgin&rsquo;s child, of wondrous wisdom, 
whose name should be God as well as man&mdash;whom all the 
heathens, amid strange darkness and mad confusions, had still 
been fearing and looking for.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
11</span><i>He is come</i>&mdash;He came on that first 
Christmas-tide.&nbsp; And we here on each Christmas-tide can 
thank God for His coming, and say before men and angels, 
&ldquo;Unto us a child is born&mdash;the Prince of Peace is 
<i>ours</i>&mdash;to His kingdom we belong&mdash;He has borne 
about on Him a man&rsquo;s body, a man&rsquo;s soul and 
spirit&mdash;He was born like us&mdash;like us He grew&mdash;like
us He rejoiced and sorrowed&mdash;tempted in all points like as 
we are, yet without sin&mdash;able to the uttermost to understand
and help all who come to God by Him.&nbsp; He has bruised the 
serpent&rsquo;s head&mdash;He has delivered us from the power of 
darkness, and brought us into <i>His</i> kingdom.&nbsp; Through 
His blood we have redemption and forgiveness&mdash;yes! through 
Him who, though He was laid in a manger, was yet the image of the
unseen God.&nbsp; And by Him, and for Him&mdash;that Babe of 
Bethlehem&mdash;were all things created in heaven and 
earth&mdash;and He is before all things, and by Him all things 
consist.&nbsp; All heaven and earth, and all the powers therein, 
are held together by Him.&nbsp; For it pleased the Father that in
<i>Him</i> should all fulness dwell; and having made peace 
through the blood of His cross, to reconcile by that child all 
things unto Himself&mdash;all things in heaven&mdash;all things 
in earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This should be our boast&mdash;this should be our 
glory&mdash;for this do we meet together every Christmas day.</p>
<p>But what is all this to us if that Blessed Man be gone away 
from us?&nbsp; Our souls want more than I have told you 
yet.&nbsp; Our souls want more than a beautiful and wonderful 
story <i>about</i> Christ.&nbsp; They want Christ Himself.&nbsp; 
Preaching is blessed and useful if it speaks of Christ.&nbsp; Our
own thoughts are blessed and useful if we think of Christ.&nbsp; 
The Bible is most blessed and useful <!-- page 12--><a 
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>containing 
all things necessary to salvation, for it speaks of Christ.&nbsp;
Our prayers are blessed and useful if in them we call and cry 
earnestly to Christ.&nbsp; But neither preaching, nor thinking, 
nor praying are enough.&nbsp; In them we think about Him and 
speak to Him.&nbsp; <i>But we want Him to speak to us</i>.&nbsp; 
We want not merely a man to say, your sins <i>may</i> be forgiven
you; we want Christ Himself to say, &ldquo;Your sins <i>are</i> 
forgiven you.&rdquo;&nbsp; We want not merely a wise book to tell
us that the good men of old belonged to Christ&rsquo;s 
kingdom&mdash;we want Christ Himself to tell us that we belong to
His kingdom.&nbsp; We want not merely a book that tells us that 
He promised always to be with us&mdash;we want Him Himself to 
tell us that He is really now with us.&nbsp; We want not merely a
promise from a prophet of old that in Him all the nations of the 
earth shall be blessed, but a sign from Christ Himself that this 
nation of England is really now blest in Him.&nbsp; In short, we 
want not words, however true words, however fine words, 
<i>about</i> Christ.&nbsp; We want Christ Himself to forgive us 
our sins&mdash;to give peace and freedom to our hearts&mdash;to 
come to us unseen, and fill us with thoughts and longings such as
our fallen nature cannot give us&mdash;such thoughts and feelings
as we cannot explain in words, for they are too deep and blessed 
to be talked about&mdash;but thoughts which say to us, as if the 
blessed Jesus Himself spoke to us in the depths of our hearts, 
&ldquo;Poor, struggling, sinful brother! <i>thou art 
mine</i>.&nbsp; For thee I was born&mdash;for thee I 
died&mdash;thee I will teach&mdash;I will guide thee and inform 
thee with mine eye&mdash;I will never leave thee nor forsake 
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well&mdash;you want <i>Him</i>&mdash;and you want a sign of 
Him&mdash;a sign of His own giving that <i>He is among you

eighteen hundred years, over half the world.&nbsp; There is the

is broken for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is the wine of which He 
said, &ldquo;This cup is the New Covenant in my blood, which is

Elizabeth of old, when men tried too curiously to enquire into 
her opinion concerning this blessed mystery&mdash;</p>

is, is not Christ among us now, indeed?&nbsp; Is not that 
something better than all the preaching in the world?&nbsp; Jesus
Christ, the King of kings&mdash;the Saviour&mdash;the 
Deliverer&mdash;the Lamb of God&mdash;the Everlasting 
Son&mdash;the Word&mdash;the Light&mdash;the Life&mdash;is here 
among us ready to feed <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span

15</span>III.&nbsp; IS, OR IS NOT, THE BIBLE TRUE?</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If I say the truth, why do ye not believe 
Me?&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">John</span> viii. 46.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is, or is not, the Bible true?&nbsp; To this question we must 
all come some day or other.&nbsp; Do you believe that that book 
which lies there, which we call the Bible, is a true book, or a 
lying book?&nbsp; Is it true or false?&nbsp; Is it right or 
wrong?&nbsp; Is it from God, or is it not from God?&nbsp; Let us 
answer that.&nbsp; If it is not from God, let it go; but if it 
<i>is</i> from God, which we know it is, how dare we disobey 
it?</p>
<p>That <i>God</i>, the maker of heaven and earth, should speak 
to men&mdash;should set His commands down in a book and give it 
to them&mdash;and that they should neglect it, disobey 
it&mdash;it is the strangest sight that can be seen on earth! 
that God in heaven should say one thing, and a human being, six 
feet high at most, should dare to do another!</p>
<p>If the Bible is from God, I say, the question is not whether 
it is <i>better</i> to obey it or not.&nbsp; Better? there is no 
better or worse in the matter&mdash;it is infinitely 
necessary.&nbsp; To obey is infinitely right, to disobey is 
infinitely wrong.&nbsp; To obey is infinitely wise, to disobey is
infinite folly.&nbsp; There can be no question about the matter, 
except in the mind of a fool.&nbsp; Better to obey God&rsquo;s 
word?&nbsp; <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Better indeed&mdash;for to obey is 
heaven, to disobey is hell.&nbsp; <i>That</i> is the 
difference.&nbsp; And at your better moments does not the voice 
within you, witness to, and agree with, the words of that 
book?&nbsp; When it tells you to care more for your soul than 
your body&mdash;more for the life to come, which is eternity, 
than for the present life which lasts but a few years&mdash;does 
not common sense tell you that?&nbsp; The Bible tells you to 
reverence and love God the giver of all good&mdash;does not 
reason tell you that?&nbsp; The Bible tells you loyally to obey, 
to love, to worship our blessed King and Saviour in heaven.&nbsp;
Does not common sense tell you that?&nbsp; Surely if there be 
such a person as Jesus Christ&mdash;if He is sitting now in 
heaven as Saviour of all, and one day to be Judge of all&mdash;by
all means <i>He</i> is to be obeyed, He is to be pleased, whoever
else we may displease.&nbsp; Reason, one would think, would tell 
us that&mdash;and it is just want of reason which makes us forget
it.</p>
<p>What have you to say against the pattern of a true and holy 
man as laid down in the Bible?&nbsp; The Bible would have you 
pure&mdash;can you deny that you ought to be that?&nbsp; It would
have you peaceable&mdash;can you deny that you ought to be 
that?&nbsp; The Bible would have you forgiving, honest, 
honourable, active, industrious.&nbsp; The Bible would have you 
generous, loving, charitable.&nbsp; Can you deny that that is 
right, however some of you may dislike it?&nbsp; The Bible would 
have you ask all you want from God, and ask forgiveness of God 
for every offence, great and small, against Him.&nbsp; Can you 
deny that that is right and reasonable?&nbsp; The Bible would 
have you live in continual remembrance that the great eye of God 
is on you&mdash;in continual thankfulness to the blessed Saviour 
who died for you and has <!-- page 17--><a 
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>redeemed you 
by His own blood&mdash;with daily and hourly prayer for 
God&rsquo;s Spirit to set your heart and your understanding right
on every point.&nbsp; Can you deny that that is all right and 
good and proper&mdash;that unless the Bible be all a dream, and 
there be no Holy and Almighty God, no merciful Christ in heaven, 
this is <span class="smcap">the</span> way and the only way to 
live?&nbsp; Ay, if there were no God, no Christ, no hereafter, it
would be better for man to live as the Bible tells him, than to 
live as too many do.&nbsp; There would be infinitely less misery,
less heart-burnings, less suffering of body and soul, if men 
followed Christ&rsquo;s example as told us in the Bible.&nbsp; 
Even if this life were all, and there were neither punishment nor
reward for us after death&mdash;does not our reason tell us that 
if all men and women were like Christ in gentleness, wisdom, and 
purity, the world as long as it lasted would be a heaven?</p>
<p>And do not your own hearts echo these thoughts at moments when
they are quietest and purest and most happy too?&nbsp; Have you 
not said to yourselves&mdash;&ldquo;Those Bible words are good 
words.&nbsp; After all, if I were like that, I should be happier 
than I am now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah! my friends, listen to those 
thoughts when they come into your hearts&mdash;they are not your 
own thoughts&mdash;they are the voice of One holier than 
you&mdash;wiser than you&mdash;One who loves you better than you 
love yourselves&mdash;One pleading with you, stirring you up by 
His Spirit, if it be but for a moment, to see the things which 
belong to your peace.</p>
<p>But what can you say for yourselves, if having once had these 
thoughts, having once settled in your own minds that the Gospel 
of God is right and you are wrong, if you persist in disobeying 
that gospel&mdash;if you agree <!-- page 18--><a 
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>one minute 
with the inner voice, which says, &ldquo;Do this and live, do 
this and be at peace with God and man, and your own 
conscience&rdquo;&mdash;and then fall back the next moment into 
the same worldly, selfish, peevish, sense-bound, miserable 
life-in-death as ever?</p>
<p>The reason, my friends, I am afraid, with most of us is, sheer
folly&mdash;not want of cunning and cleverness, but want of 
heart&mdash;want of feeling&mdash;what Solomon calls folly (Prov.
i. 22-27), stupidity of soul, when he calls on the simple souls, 
How long ye simple ones will you love simplicity or silliness, 
and the scorners delight in their scorning (delight in laughing 
at what is good), and fools hate knowledge&mdash;hate to think 
earnestly or steadily about anything&mdash;the stupidity of the 
ass, who is too stubborn and thick-skinned to turn out of his way
for any one&mdash;or the stupidity of the swine, who cares for 
his food and nothing further&mdash;or worse than all, the 
stupidity of the ape, who cares for nothing but play and 
curiosity, and the vain and frivolous amusements of the 
moment.</p>
<p>All these tempers are common enough, and they may be joined 
with cleverness enough.&nbsp; What beast so clever as an ape? yet
what beast so foolish, so mean, so useless?&nbsp; But this is the
fault of stupidity&mdash;it blinds our eyes to the world of 
spirits; it makes us forget God; it makes us see first what we 
can lay our hands on, and nothing more; it makes us forget that 
we have souls.&nbsp; Our glorious minds and thoughts, which 
should be stretching on through all eternity, are cramped down to
thinking of nothing further than this little hour of earthly 
life.&nbsp; Our glorious hearts, which should be delighting in 
everything which is lovely, and generous, and pure, and 
beautiful, and God-like&mdash;ay, delighting <!-- page 19--><a 
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>in God 
Himself&mdash;are turned in upon themselves, and set upon our own
gain, our own ease, our own credit.&nbsp; In short, our immortal 
souls, made in God&rsquo;s image, become no use to us by this 
stupidity&mdash;they seem for mere salt to keep our bodies from 
decaying.</p>
<p>Whose work is that?&nbsp; The devil&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But whose 
<i>fault</i> is it?&nbsp; Do you suppose that the devil has any 
right in you, any power in you, who have been washed in the 
waters of baptism and redeemed by Christ from the service of the 
devil, and signed with His Cross on your foreheads, <i>unless you
give him power</i>?&nbsp; Not he.&nbsp; Men&rsquo;s sins open the
door to the devil, and when he is in, he will soon trample down 
the good seed that is springing up, and stamp the mellow soil as 
hard as iron, so that nothing but his own seeds can grow there, 
and so keep off the dews of God&rsquo;s spirit, and the working 
of God&rsquo;s own gospel from making any impression on that 
hardened stupified soil.</p>
<p>Alas! poor soul.&nbsp; And thy misery is double, because thou 
knowest not that thou art miserable; and thy misery is treble, 
because thou hast brought it on thyself!</p>
<p>My friends&mdash;there is an ancient fable of the Jews, which,
though it is not true, yet has a deep and holy meaning, and 
teaches an awful lesson.</p>
<p>There lived, says an ancient Jewish Scribe, by the shores of 
the Dead Sea, a certain tribe of men, utterly given up to 
pleasure and covetousness, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
eye, and the pride of life.&nbsp; To them the prophet Moses was 
sent, and preached to them, warning them of repentance and of 
judgment to come&mdash;trying to awaken their souls to high and 
holy thoughts, and bring them back to the thought of God and 
heaven.&nbsp; <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>And they, poor fools, listened to 
Him, admired his preaching, agreed that it all sounded very 
good&mdash;but that he went too far&mdash;that it was too 
difficult&mdash;that their present way of life was very 
pleasant&mdash;that they saw no such great need of change, and so
on, one excuse after another, till they began to be tired of 
Moses, and gave him to understand that he was impertinent, 
troublesome&mdash;that they could see nothing wise in 
him&mdash;nothing great; how could they?&nbsp; So Moses went his 
way, and left them to go theirs.&nbsp; And long after, when some 
travellers came by, says the fable, they found these foolish 
people were all changed into dumb beasts; what they had tried to 
be, now they really were.&nbsp; They had made no use of their 
souls, and now they had lost them; they had given themselves up 
to folly, and now folly had taken to her own; they had fancied, 
as people do every day, that this world is a great play-ground, 
wherein every one has to amuse himself as he likes best, or at 
all events a great shop and gambling-house, where the most 
cunning wins most of his neighbour&rsquo;s money; and now 
according to their faith it was to them.&nbsp; They had forgotten
God and spiritual things, and now they were hid from their 
eyes.&nbsp; And these travellers found them sitting, playing 
antics, quarrelling for the fruits of the field&mdash;mere 
beasts&mdash;reaping as they had sown, and filled full with the 
fruit of their own devices.</p>
<p>Only every Sabbath day, says the fable, there came over these 
poor wretches an awful sense of a piercing Eye watching them from
above&mdash;a dim feeling that they had been something better and
nobler once&mdash;a faint recollection of heavenly things which 
they once knew when they were little children&mdash;a blind dread
of some awful unseen ruin, into which their miserable empty <!-- 
page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
21</span>beast-life was swiftly and steadily sweeping them 
down;&mdash;and then they tried to think and could not&mdash;and 
tried to remember and could not&mdash;and so they sat there every
Sabbath day, cowering with fear, uneasy and moaning, and 
half-remembered that they once had souls!</p>
<p>My friends, my friends, are there not too many now-a-days like
these poor dwellers by the Dead Sea, who seem to have lost all of
God&rsquo;s image except their bodies? who all the week dote on 
the business and the pleasures of this life, going on very 
comfortably till they seem to have quite hardened their own 
souls; and now and then on Sabbath days when they come to church,
and pretend to pray and worship, sit all vacant, stupid, their 
hearts far away, or with a sort of passing uneasiness and dim 
feeling that all is not right&mdash;<i>try to think and 
cannot</i>&mdash;<i>try to pray and cannot</i>&mdash;and, like 
those dwellers by the Dead Sea, once a week on Sabbath day half 
remember that they once had souls?</p>
<p>So true it is, that from him that hath not, shall be taken 
away even that which he seemeth to have.&nbsp; So true it is, 
that the wages of sin is death; death to the soul even in this 
life.&nbsp; So true it is that why men do not believe Christ, is 
because they cannot hear His word.&nbsp; So true it is, that only
the pure in heart shall see God, or love god-like men and 
god-like words.&nbsp; So true it is, that he that soweth the wind
shall reap the whirlwind, and that he who <i>will</i> not hear 
Christ&rsquo;s words, shall soon not be <i>able</i> to hear them;
that he who will not have Christ for his master, must soon be 
content to have the devil for his master, and for his wages, 
spiritual death.&nbsp; From which sad fate of spiritual death may
the blessed Saviour, in His infinite mercy, deliver us.</p>

22</span>IV.&nbsp; THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE AND THE TREE OF LIFE; 
OR, THE FALL.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now the serpent was more subtile than any 
beast of the field which the Lord God had made.&nbsp; And he said
unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every 
tree of the garden?&nbsp; And the woman said unto the serpent, We
may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: but of the fruit
of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, 
Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye 
die.&nbsp; And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not 
surely die.&nbsp; For God doth know that in the day ye eat 
thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods,
knowing good and evil.&nbsp; And when the woman saw that the tree
was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a 
tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit 
thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; 
and he did eat.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Genesis</span> 
iii. 1-6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a lesson for us all.&nbsp; You and I, and all men 
brought into the world with us a nature which fell in Adam; and, 
as it fell <i>before</i> we were born, it is certain enough to 
fall, again and again, after we are born, in this life; ay, and 
unless we take care, to fall lower and lower, every day, acting 
Adam&rsquo;s sin over again, until we surely die.&nbsp; This is 
what I mean&mdash;What God said to Adam and Eve, He says to every
one of us.&nbsp; And what the devil said to Adam and Eve, he will
say to every one of us.</p>
<p>First.&nbsp; God says to us, &ldquo;Of all the trees of the 
garden <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>thou mayest freely eat: but of the 
tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat, lest thou 
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of all the trees of the garden thou mayest freely eat.&nbsp; 
God grudges you nothing good for you.&nbsp; He has put you into 
this good and pleasant world, where you will find pleasures 
enough, and comforts enough, to satisfy you, if you are wise; but
there are things which God has forbidden you, not out of any 
spite or arbitrariness, but because they are bad for you; because
they will hurt you if you indulge in them, and sooner or later, 
kill both body and soul.</p>
<p>Now, many of those wrong things look pleasant enough, and 
reasonable enough, as the forbidden fruit did.&nbsp; Pleasant to 
the eyes and good for food&mdash;and to be desired to make you 
wise.&nbsp; As people grow up and go out into life, they are 
tempted to do many things which their parents forbid, which the 
Bible forbids, which the law of the land forbids, and they do not
understand at first why they are forbidden any more than Adam and
Eve understood why they were not to eat of the forbidden 
fruit.</p>
<p>Then the devil (who is always trying to slander God to us) 
whispers to them, as he did to Eve, &ldquo;How unreasonable! how 
hard on you.&nbsp; People say that this is wrong, and you must 
not do it, and yet how pleasant it must be!&nbsp; How much money 
you might get by it&mdash;how much wiser, and cleverer, and more 
able to help yourself you would become, if you went your own way,
and did what you like.&nbsp; Surely God is hard on you, and 
grudges you pleasure.&nbsp; Never mind&mdash;don&rsquo;t be 
afraid.&nbsp; Surely you can judge best what is good for 
you.&nbsp; Surely you know your own business best.&nbsp; Use your
own common sense and do what you like, and what you <!-- page 
24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>think
will profit you.&nbsp; Are you to be a slave to old rules which 
your parents or the clergyman taught you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So says the devil to every young man as he goes out in 
life.&nbsp; And to many, alas!&mdash;to many, the devil&rsquo;s 
words sound reasonable enough; they flatter our fallen nature, 
they flatter our pride and our self-will, and make us fancy we 
are going up hill, and becoming very fine and manly, and 
independent and knowing.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;<i>Knowing</i>&rdquo;!&nbsp; How many a young man have I 
seen run into sin just that he might be <i>knowing</i>; and say, 
&ldquo;Why should I not see life for myself?&nbsp; Why should I 
not know the world, and try what is good, and how I like that, 
and what is bad too, and how I like that&mdash;and then choose 
for myself like a man, instead of being kept in like a 
baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he says exactly what Adam and Eve said in their 
hearts&mdash;&ldquo;I will eat of the tree of knowledge of good 
and evil.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says in his heart, too, just what 
Solomon the wise said, when he, too, determined to eat of the 
fruit of the tree of knowledge.</p>
<p>Ay, young people, who love to see the world, and to choose for
yourselves, read that Book of Ecclesiastes, the saddest book on 
earth, and get a golden lesson in every verse of it.&nbsp; See 
how Solomon determined to see life, from the top to the bottom of
it.&nbsp; How he &ldquo;gave his heart to know, seek, and search 
out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under 
heaven.&nbsp; I have seen all the works that are done under the 
sun, and behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit,&rdquo; 
(Eccles. i. 13).</p>
<p>And then, how he turned round and gave his heart to know 
mirth, and madness, and folly, and see whether <i>that</i> was 
good for him, and, &ldquo;I said of laughter, it is <!-- page 
25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>mad: 
and of mirth, what doeth it?&rdquo; (Eccles. ii. 2-26).&nbsp; And
then he gave himself to wine and revelling, and after that to 
riches, and pomp, and glory, and music, and the &ldquo;fine 
arts,&rdquo; as we call them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I made me great works;
I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: I made me gardens 
and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits: 
I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that 
bringeth forth trees: I got me servants and maidens, and had 
servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great 
and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me: I 
gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of 
kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women 
singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical 
instruments, and that of all sorts.&nbsp; So I was great, and 
increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my
wisdom remained with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what was the end?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then I looked on all the works that my hand had done, and 
on the labour that I had laboured to do: and behold all was 
vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the 
sun.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore, he says, that he hated all the 
labour he had taken under the sun, because he must leave it to 
the men who came after him, and found out at last, after years of
labour and sorrow, trying to make himself happy with this and 
that, and finding no rest with any of them, that the conclusion 
of the whole matter was to &ldquo;Fear God and keep his 
commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.&nbsp; For God 
shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, 
whether it be good or evil&rdquo; (Eccles. xii. 13).</p>
<p>So said Solomon&mdash;and God knows, my dear friends, God 
knows, he said truly.&nbsp; Ay, and I know it to be true; <!-- 
page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
26</span>and I entreat you this day, in God&rsquo;s name, to hear
the conclusion of the whole matter.&nbsp; All this you will find 
out by eating of the tree of knowledge, and &ldquo;<i>seeing 
life</i>,&rdquo; and going your own way, and falling into sin, 
and smarting for it, for weary years, in anxiety and perplexity, 
and shame, and sorrow of heart.</p>
<p>All that you will find out thereby&mdash;all that Solomon 
found out thereby,&mdash;is just what you know already, and 
nothing more&mdash;just what you have been taught ever since you 
could speak.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fear God and keep his commandments, for
this is the whole duty of man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why buy your own 
experience dear, when you can get it gratis, for nothing 
already?</p>
<p>Yes; a simple, godly, industrious life, doing the duty which 
lies nearest you, avoiding sin as you would an adder, because it 
is sure sooner or later to sting you, if you touch it, is the 
straight road, and the only road, to happiness, either in this 
life, or in the life to come.&nbsp; Pleasure and amusement, 
drinking and jollity, will not make you happy.&nbsp; Money will 
not make you happy.&nbsp; Cleverness, and cunning, and knowledge 
of the world will not make you happy.&nbsp; Scholarship and 
learning will not.&nbsp; But plain, simple righteousness, simply 
doing right, <i>will</i>.</p>
<p>Do right then and be happy.&nbsp; Obey God&rsquo;s 
commandments, and you will find that His commandments are 
<i>Life</i>, and in the pathway thereof there is no death.</p>
<p>Make up your minds to do right, to be right, to keep right by 
the help of God&rsquo;s Right and Holy Spirit, in the right 
road.&nbsp; Make up your minds whether you will go through the 
world in God&rsquo;s way, or your own way&mdash;whether you will 
taste what God has forbidden, and so <!-- page 27--><a 
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>destroy 
yourselves, or obey Him and live with Him in bliss.&nbsp; The 
longer you delay, the more difficult you will find it.&nbsp; Make
up your minds now, and ask God to teach you His own heavenly 
wisdom which is a Tree of Life to all that lay hold on it.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I AM hath sent me into 
you.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Exodus</span> iii. 10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every day I find it more and more true, that the Bible is full
of good news from beginning to end.&nbsp; The 
<i>Gospel</i>&mdash;that is good news&mdash;and the best of all 
good news, is to be found in every book of it; perhaps if we knew
how to search the Scriptures, in every chapter and verse of it, 
from beginning to end.&nbsp; For from beginning to end, from 
Genesis to Malachi&mdash;from the Gospel of St. Matthew to the 
end of the Revelation&mdash;what our Lord said of the Bible 
stands true: &ldquo;They (the Scriptures) are they which testify 
of ME&rdquo; (John v. 39).&nbsp; The whole Bible testifies, bears
witness of Him, the One Unchangeable Christ, who said to Moses, 
&ldquo;Say unto the people, I AM hath sent me unto 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now let us think a while what that text means; for it has not 
to do with Moses only, but with all God&rsquo;s prophets, 
evangelists, preachers.&nbsp; David might have said the same to 
the Jews in his time, &ldquo;I AM hath sent me unto 
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Elijah, Isaiah, St. Matthew, St. John, St. 
Paul, might have said the same.&nbsp; And so may God&rsquo;s 
ministers now.&nbsp; And I, however sinful, or ignorant, or 
unfaithful to my duty I may be, have still a right to say, as I 
do now say solemnly and earnestly to you, &ldquo;I AM hath sent 
me unto you&rdquo; this day.</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
29</span>But what do I mean by that?&nbsp; That ought to depend 
on what Moses meant by it.&nbsp; Moses meant what God meant, and 
unless I mean the same thing I must mean something wrong.&nbsp; 
And this is what I think it does mean:</p>
<p>First.&nbsp; I AM&mdash;the Lord Jesus Christ told Moses that 
his name was I AM.&nbsp; Now you perhaps think that this is but a
very common place name, for every one can say of himself&mdash;I 
am&mdash;and it may seem strange that God should have chosen for 
His own especial name, words which you and I might have chosen 
for ourselves just as well.&nbsp; I daresay you think that you 
may fairly say &ldquo;<i>you are</i>,&rdquo; and that I can say 
fairly that &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet it is not so.&nbsp; If I say &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; I say
what is not true of me.&nbsp; I must say &ldquo;I am 
something&mdash;I am a man, I am bad, or I am good, or I am an 
Englishman, I am a soldier, I am a sailor, I am a 
clergyman&rdquo;&mdash;and then I shall say what is true of 
me.&nbsp; But God alone can say &ldquo;I AM&rdquo; without saying
anything more.</p>
<p>And why?&nbsp; Because God alone <i>is</i>.&nbsp; Everybody 
and everything else in the world <i>becomes</i>: but God 
<i>is</i>.&nbsp; We are all becoming something from our birth to 
our death&mdash;changing continually and becoming something 
different from what we were a minute before; first of all we were
created and made, <i>and so became men</i>; and since that we 
have been every moment changing, becoming older, becoming wiser, 
or alas! foolisher; becoming stronger or weaker; becoming better 
or worse.&nbsp; Even our bodies are changing and becoming 
different day by day.</p>
<p>But God never changes or becomes anything different from what 
He is now.&nbsp; What He is, that He was, and ever will be.&nbsp;
God does not even become older.&nbsp; This may seem very strange,
but it is true: for God made <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Time, God 
made the years; and once there were no years to count by, no 
years at all.&nbsp; Remember how long had God Himself been, 
before He made Time, when there was no Time to pass over?&nbsp; 
Remember always that God must have created Time.&nbsp; If God did
not create Time, no one else did; for there is, as the Athanasian
Creed says, &ldquo;One uncreated and One eternal,&rdquo; even God
who made Time as well as all things else.</p>
<p>Am I puzzling you?&nbsp; What I want to do is to make you 
understand that God&rsquo;s life is quite utterly different from 
our life, or any way of living and being which we can fancy or 
think of; lest you make to yourselves the likeness of anything in
heaven above or of the earth beneath, and think that God is like 
that and so worship it, and have other gods beside the true God, 
and so break the first and second commandments, as thousands do 
who fancy themselves good Protestants, and hate Popery and 
idolatry, and yet worship a very different sort of god from the 
&ldquo;I AM,&rdquo; who sent Moses to the children of 
Israel.&nbsp; Remember then this at least, that God was before 
all things, and all worlds, and all Time; so that there was a 
time when there were no worlds, and a time when there was no 
Time&mdash;nothing but God alone, absolute, eternal, neither made
nor created, the same that He is now and will be for ever.</p>
<p>When I say &ldquo;God is,&rdquo; that is a very different 
thing from God Himself saying, &ldquo;I AM.&rdquo;&nbsp; A 
different thing?&nbsp; Oh! my friends, here is the root of the 
whole Gospel, the root of all our hope for this world and for the
world to come&mdash;for ourselves, for our own future, and the 
future of all the world.&nbsp; Do you not see how?&nbsp; Then I 
will try to explain.</p>
<p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
31</span>Many heathen men have known that there was one eternal 
God, and that <i>God is</i>.&nbsp; But they did not know that God
Himself had said so; and that made them anxious, puzzled, almost 
desperate, so that the wiser they were, the unhappier they 
were.&nbsp; For what use is it merely knowing that &ldquo;<i>God 
is</i>&rdquo;?&nbsp; The question for poor human creatures is, 
&ldquo;But what sort of a being is God?&nbsp; Is He far 
off?&nbsp; Millions of miles from this earth?&nbsp; Does He care 
nothing about us?&nbsp; Does He let the world go its own way 
right or wrong?&nbsp; Is He proud and careless?&nbsp; A 
self-glorifying Deity whose mercy is <i>not</i> over all His 
works, or even over any of them?&nbsp; Or does He care for 
us?&nbsp; Does He see us?&nbsp; Will He speak to us?&nbsp; Has He
ever spoken to any one?&nbsp; Has He ever told any one about 
Himself?&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>There is the question</i>&mdash;the 
question of all questions.&nbsp; And if a man once begins 
thinking about his own soul, and this world, and God,&mdash;till 
he gets that question answered, he can have no comfort about 
himself or the world, or anything&mdash;till in fact he knows 
whether God has ever spoken to men or not.</p>
<p>And the glory of the Bible, the power of God revealed in the 
Bible, is, that it answers the question, and says, &ldquo;God 
<i>does</i> care for men, God <i>does</i> see men, God is not far
off from any one of us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ay, God speaks to 
men&mdash;God spoke to Moses and said, not &ldquo;God is&rdquo; 
but &ldquo;I AM.&rdquo;&nbsp; God in sundry times and in divers 
manners <i>spoke</i> to our fathers by the Prophets and said 
&ldquo;I AM.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But more&mdash;Moses said, &ldquo;I AM hath sent 
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; God does not merely love us, and yet leave us to
ourselves.&nbsp; He sends after us.&nbsp; He sends to us.&nbsp; 
In old times He sent prophets and wise men one after the other to
preach repentance and righteousness, and to teach men all that 
<!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
32</span>was good for them; and when men would not listen to 
them, but shut their ears to them and drove them out, killing 
some and beating some, God was so determined to send to men, so 
unwearied, so patient, so earnest, so loving still, that He said,
&ldquo;I will send now my own Son, surely they will hear 
Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, my friends, this is the I AM.&nbsp; This is 
God&mdash;this is our God&mdash;this is our Heavenly Father; not 
a proud and selfish Being, who looks down haughtily from afar off
on all the misery and ignorance of the world, but as a wise man 
of old said, &ldquo;A most merciful God, a revealer of secrets, 
who showeth to man the things which he knew not.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
This is our God&mdash;not a tyrant, but a Deliverer&mdash;not a 
condemning God, but a saving God, who wills that none should 
perish, who sends to seek and to save those who are lost, who 
sends His sun to shine on the just and the unjust, and is good to
the unthankful and the evil.&nbsp; A God who so loved the world 
which He had made, in spite of all its sin and follies, that He 
spared not His only begotten Son, but freely gave Him for 
it.&nbsp; A God who sits on His throne for ever judging right, 
and ministering true judgment among the people, who from His 
throne beholds all those who dwell upon the earth, and fashions 
the hearts of them, and understandeth all their works.&nbsp; A 
God who comes out of His place to visit the wrong done on the 
earth, and be a refuge for the oppressed, and a help in time of 
trouble, to help the fatherless and poor unto their right, that 
the men of this world be no more exalted against them.</p>
<p>This is <i>our God</i>.&nbsp; This is our Father&mdash;always 
condescending, always patient, always loving, always just.&nbsp; 
And always active, always working to <i>do good</i> to all his 
creatures, like that exact pattern and copy of Himself, <!-- page
33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>the 
Lord Jesus Christ, who said, &ldquo;My Father worketh hitherto, 
and I work.&rdquo;&nbsp; (John v. 17).</p>
<p>But again: &ldquo;I AM hath sent me unto 
<i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unto whom?&nbsp; Who was Moses sent to?&nbsp; To the Children 
of Israel in Egypt.&nbsp; And what sort of people were 
they?&nbsp; Were they wise and learned?&nbsp; On the contrary 
they were stupid, ignorant, and brutish.&nbsp; Were they pious 
and godly?&nbsp; On the contrary they were worshipping the 
foolish idols of the Egyptians&mdash;so fond of idolatry that 
they must needs make a golden calf and worship it.&nbsp; Were 
they respectable and cleanly livers?&nbsp; Were they teachable 
and obedient?&nbsp; On the contrary, they were profligate, 
stiff-necked, murmurers, disobedient, unwilling to trust 
God&rsquo;s goodness, though He had shown them all those glorious
signs and wonders for their sakes, and brought them out of Egypt 
with a mighty hand and a stretched-out arm.&nbsp; Were they 
high-spirited and brave?&nbsp; On the contrary, they were 
mean-spirited and cowards, murmuring against Moses and against 
God, if anything went wrong, for setting them free; ready to go 
back and be slaves to the Egyptians rather than face danger and 
fight; looking back and longing after the flesh-pots of Egypt, 
where they eat bread to the full, and willing to be slaves again 
and have all their men children drowned in the river, and 
themselves put to hard labour in the brick kilns, if they could 
only fill their stomachs.&nbsp; And even at best when Moses had 
brought them to the very edge of that rich land of Canaan, which 
God had promised them, they were afraid to go into it, and win it
for themselves; and God had to send them back again, to wander 
forty years in the wilderness, till all that cowardly, base, 
first generation, who came up out of Egypt was dead, and a new 
generation had grown up, made <!-- page 34--><a 
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>brave and 
hardy by their long training in the deserts, and taught to trust 
and obey God from their youth; and so able and willing to conquer
the good land which God had promised them.</p>
<p>Altogether the Children of Israel, to whom God sent Moses, 
were plainly an ignorant, brutish, cowardly set of people, fallen
lower far than the negroes of South America, fit to be slaves and
nothing better.</p>
<p>Then why did God take such trouble for them?&nbsp; Why did God
care for them, and help them, and work wonders for them?&nbsp; 
Why?&nbsp; Exactly because they <i>were</i> so bad.&nbsp; He that
hath ears to hear let him hear, and understand by this example of
all examples what manner of God our God is.&nbsp; Just because 
they were so bad, His goodness yearned over them all the more, 
and longed to make them good.&nbsp; Just because they were so 
unclean and brutish His holiness longed all the more to cleanse 
them.&nbsp; Because they were so stupid and ignorant, His wisdom 
longed to make them wise.&nbsp; Because they were so miserable, 
His pity yearned over them, as a father over a child fallen into 
danger.&nbsp; Because they were sick, they had all the more need 
of a physician.&nbsp; Because they were lost, there was all the 
more reason for seeking and saving them.&nbsp; Because they were 
utterly weak, God desired all the more to put His strength into 
them, that His strength might be made perfect in weakness.</p>
<p>True, God&rsquo;s goodness seemed of little use to too many of
them.&nbsp; Their history during the next forty years was a very 
sad one.&nbsp; With many of them God was not well pleased, the 
Bible tells us, and their carcases fell in the Wilderness.&nbsp; 
A sad forty years they were for Moses also, as he says in that 
sad and glorious Psalm of his (Ps. xc. 7, 8): &ldquo;We consume 
away in thy displeasure, and are <!-- page 35--><a 
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>afraid of thy
wrathful indignation.&nbsp; Thou hast set our misdeeds before us,
our secret sins in the light of thy countenance, for when Thou 
art angry our days are gone: we bring our years to an end as a 
tale that is told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that was all their own fault.&nbsp; God never left them 
for all those forty years.&nbsp; He fed them with manna in the 
wilderness, and the angel of His presence preserved them.</p>
<p>And now, my friends, remember what I have said of God in this 
text, &ldquo;I AM hath sent me unto you,&rdquo; and see how it 
preaches to you an almighty, unchangeable Father, whose mercy is 
over all His works, full of love and care for all, longing and 
labouring for ever by His Son Jesus Christ to raise us from the 
death of sin (which is the only death we need to be afraid of) to
the life of righteousness&mdash;the only life worth living here, 
the only life which we can live beyond the grave!&nbsp; A just 
God, a merciful God, a patient God, a generous God, a gracious 
God; a God whose glory is to save&mdash;a God who is utterly 
worthy of our love and respect&mdash;a God whom we can 
trust&mdash;a God whom it is worth while to obey&mdash;a God who 
deserves our thanks from our cradle to our grave&mdash;a God to 
whom we ought honestly, and from the bottom of our hearts to say,
now and for ever:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We worship Thee, we bless Thee, we praise Thee, we 
magnify Thee, we give thanks to Thee for Thy great glory, oh! 
Lord God, Heavenly King, God the Father Almighty.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All the commandments which I command thee 
this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, 
and go in and possess the land which the Lord sware unto your 
fathers.&nbsp; And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord
thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble 
thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether
thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.&nbsp; And he humbled 
thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which
thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might 
make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every
word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live. 
. . . Thou shall also consider in thine heart that, as a man 
chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth 
thee.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Deut.</span> viii. 1, 2, 
3, 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As God led the Jews through the wilderness, so He leads us 
through the journey of life.&nbsp; As God called on the Jews to 
rejoice in Him, and to bless Him for going with them, and 
teaching and training them by dangers and sorrows; so He calls on
us to lift up our hearts and bless Him for teaching and training 
us in the battle of life.</p>
<p>But some of you may say, &ldquo;Why do you ask us to thank God
for lessons which we have bought by labour and sorrow?&nbsp; Are 
not our sorrows more than our joys?&nbsp; Our labour far heavier 
than our rest can be sweet?&nbsp; You tell us to be joyful and 
thank God for His mercies; but why all this toil?&nbsp; Why must 
we work on, and on, and on, all our days, in weariness and <!-- 
page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
37</span>anxiety?&nbsp; Why must we only toil, toil, till we die,
and lie down, fairly conquered and worn out, on that stern mother
earth, from whom we have been wringing our paltry livelihood from
our boyhood to our grave?&nbsp; What is our life but labour and 
sorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Are not some of you thinking in this way to-day?&nbsp; Have I 
not guessed the hearts of some of you at least?&nbsp; And is not 
this a strange way of making you joyful to remind you of these 
thoughts?</p>
<p>My friends, be sure I only remind you of these sad thoughts, 
because they are <i>true</i> thoughts, because God meant you to 
bear them and <i>face</i> them like men; because you must have 
these thoughts, and let them make you sad, and make up your minds
to face them again and again, before even you can thank God 
really like redeemed, immortal Christian men and women.&nbsp; And
believe me, I would not mention these sad thoughts, if I had not 
a remedy for them.&nbsp; If I had not a message to you from the 
living God, and Christ the King of the earth, whereby I tell you 
now to rejoice and give thanks to Him in spite of all your labour
and sorrow.&nbsp; Ay more, I say, Rejoice and give thanks <i>on 
account</i> of all your labour and sorrow, and count it all 
<i>joy</i> when ye fall into divers tribulations.</p>
<p>It is true, my friends, we are a hard working and a somewhat 
sad race of men, we English.&nbsp; The life of the working man is
labour and sorrow, and so is the life of the scholar, and so is 
the life of even many a rich man.&nbsp; All things are full of 
labour in England.&nbsp; Man cannot utter it, the eye is not 
satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing; we are the 
wisest of all nations; and yet as Solomon says, behold in much 
wisdom is much grief; and in increasing knowledge, we still 
increase sorrow.</p>
<p><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
38</span>Truly, I may say of us Englishmen, as Paul said of the 
Christians of his time, that if Christ be not raised from the 
dead, and if in this life <i>only</i> we have hope in Him, we are
of all nations one of the most unhappy.&nbsp; When we look at all
the hundreds of thousands pent up in our great cities among filth
and smoke, toiling in factories, in workshops, in dark mines 
under ground&mdash;when we think of the soldier on the march 
under the sultry sun of India, the sailor on the stormy 
sea&mdash;when we think of this our bleak inclement climate, our 
five months of winter every year;&mdash;no man&rsquo;s food and 
clothing to be gained but by bitter toil, either of himself or of
others&mdash;and then when we compare our lot with that of the 
dwellers in hot countries, in India and in Africa, and the 
islands of the South Seas, where men live with no care, no 
labour&mdash;where clothes and fire are never needed&mdash;where 
every tree bears delicious food, and man lives in perpetual 
summer, in careless health and beauty, among continual mirth and 
ease, like the birds which know no care&mdash;then it seems at 
moments as if God had been unfair in giving so much more to the 
savage than He has to us, of the blessings of this earthly life; 
and we are led to long that our lot was cast in those fruitful 
and delicious climates of the South, in a continual paradise of 
mirth and plenty, and beauty and sunshine.</p>
<p>But no, my friends, we are more blest than the careless Indian
who never knows what labour is; his life is but the life of the 
butterfly, which flutters from flower to flower and sports in the
sunshine, and sucks sweets for a brief hour, and then perishes 
without hope.&nbsp; His life is a dream, he sees no heaven before
him, he knows no glorious God, with the sight of whom he is to be
blest for ever.&nbsp; His body may be in perpetual ease, and 
health, <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>and beauty for a few short years, but
what care has he for his undying spirit, that is blind and dead 
within him?</p>
<p>But to bring a man&rsquo;s soul to life, to train and educate 
a man&rsquo;s soul that it may go on from strength to strength, 
and glory to glory till it appears in the presence of 
God&mdash;that wants a stern and a severe training of sorrow and 
labour, of which the poor, pampered, luxurious savage knows 
nothing.&nbsp; This is why Christ brought our forefathers into 
this bleak, cold, northern land, and forced them to gain their 
bread by the sweat of their brows, and the sorrows of their 
hearts, and to keep their land by many wars.</p>
<p>Now this is the reason of our carefulness, of our many 
troubles, that God is educating and training us English; that He 
will not have us be savages, but Christian citizens; He will have
us not merely happy, but <i>blessed</i> through all 
eternity.&nbsp; He will not have us to be like the poor Indians, 
slaves to our flesh and our appetites&mdash;slaves to the 
pleasant things around us; but He will have us fill the earth and
subdue it; He will have England the light of the 
nations&mdash;and Englishmen preach freedom, and wisdom, and 
prudence, and the gospel of Jesus Christ to all the nations of 
the earth.&nbsp; Therefore Christ afflicts us because He loves 
us, because whom He loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son
whom He receiveth.&nbsp; Because He has ordained England to 
preach the Cross, therefore He will have England bear the 
cross.</p>
<p>It has often struck me, my friends, as a beautiful and a deep 
sign, a blessed ordinance of the great and wise God, that the 
flag of England, and especially the flag of our navy&mdash;the 
flag which is loved and reverenced through all the world, as the 
bringer of free communion between nation and nation, the bringer 
of order and equal justice <!-- page 40--><a 
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>and holy 
freedom, and the divine majesty of law, and the light of the 
blessed gospel wherever it goes; that this flag, I say, should be
the red-cross flag, the flag of the Cross of Christ&mdash;a 
double sign&mdash;a sign to all men that we are a Christian 
nation, a gospel people; and a sign, too, to ourselves, that we 
are meant to bear Christ&rsquo;s cross&mdash;to bear the 
afflictions which He lays upon us&mdash;to be made perfect 
through sufferings, to crucify the flesh with its affections and 
lusts, that we may be brave and self-denying; going forth in 
Christ&rsquo;s strength, remembering that it is He who gives us 
power to get wealth; that we ought to fight His battles, that we 
ought to spread His name at home and abroad; and rejoice in every
sorrow, which teaches us more and more the blessed meaning of His
saving name, and the share which we have in it.</p>
<p>I have said that we are a melancholy people.&nbsp; Foreigners 
all say of us, that we are the saddest of all people; that when 
they come to England, they are struck with our silence, and 
gloominess, and careworn faces, and our want of merriment and 
cheerfulness.&nbsp; And yet, with all this, we are the greatest 
of nations at this day&mdash;the strongest and the most 
industrious and the wisest.&nbsp; The gospel of Jesus Christ is 
preached oftener, and more simply, and more fully here in England
than in any nation, and I dare to say it, that in spite of all 
our sins, there are as many or more of God&rsquo;s true saints, 
more holy men and women among English people at this moment, than
among any people of the earth.&nbsp; And why? because there are 
so many among us who have hope in Christ beyond this life, who 
look for everlasting salvation through all eternity to His 
name.&nbsp; If in this life only we have hope in Christ, <!-- 
page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
41</span>truly of all people we should be most miserable; but 
Christ is risen from the dead, and He has ascended up on high, 
and led captivity captive, and received gifts for men.&nbsp; He 
sits even now at God&rsquo;s right hand praying for us.&nbsp; To 
Him all power is given in heaven and earth, and He is our 
covenant God and Saviour, He is our King.&nbsp; He is ours; and 
He will have us put on His likeness, and with Him be made perfect
through sufferings&mdash;<i>through sufferings</i>, for sorrow is
the gate of life.&nbsp; Through much tribulation we enter into 
the kingdom of God; without weary pain none of us is born into 
the world; without weary labour not a harvest in England is grown
and reaped; without weary thought, and teaching, and correction, 
not a child among us is educated to be a man; without weary 
thought and weary labour, not one of us can do his duty in that 
station of life to which Christ has called him.&nbsp; Not without
weary struggles and arguings and contentions, by martyrdoms, by 
desperate wars, our forefathers won for us our religion, our 
freedom and our laws, which make England the wonder of the 
world.&nbsp; This is the great law of our life&mdash;to be made 
perfect through sufferings, as our Lord and Master was before 
us.&nbsp; He has dealt with us, as my text tells you He dealt 
with the Jews, His chosen people of old, as He deals with every 
soul of man on whom He sets His love.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the 
commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to 
do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the 
land which the Lord sware unto your fathers.&nbsp; And thou shalt
remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these forty 
years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to 
know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep His 
commandments, or no.&nbsp; And He <!-- page 42--><a 
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>humbled thee,
and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou 
knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that He might make 
thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word
that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live . . . 
Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man 
chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth 
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For, believe me, my friends, whatever nation or whatever man 
Christ chooses to be His own, and to be holy and noble and 
glorious with Him, He makes them perfect through suffering.&nbsp;
First, He stirs up in them strange longings after what is great 
and good.&nbsp; He makes them hunger and thirst after 
righteousness, and then He lets them see how nothing on this 
earth, nothing beautiful or nothing pleasant which they can get 
or invent for themselves will satisfy; and so He teaches them to 
look to Him, to look for peace and salvation from heaven and not 
from earth.&nbsp; Then He leads them, as He led the Jews of old, 
through the wilderness and through the sea, through strange 
afflictions, through poverty, and war, and labour, that they may 
learn to know that He is leading them and not themselves; that 
they may learn to trust not in themselves, but in Him; not in 
their own strength: but in the bread which cometh down from 
heaven; not in their own courage, but in Him; and just when all 
seems most hopeless, He makes one of them chase a thousand, and 
by strange and unexpected providences, and the courage which a 
just cause inspires, brings His people triumphant through 
temptation and danger, and puts to flight the armies of the 
heathen, and the inventions of the evil fiend, and glorifies His 
name in His chosen people.</p>
<p>So He calls out in the heart of men and of the heart <!-- page
43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>of 
nations, the two great twin virtues, which always go hand in 
hand&mdash;Faith in God, and Faith in themselves.&nbsp; He lets 
them feel themselves foolish that they may learn how to be wise 
in His wisdom.&nbsp; He lets them find themselves weak that they 
may learn how to be strong in His strength.&nbsp; Then sometimes 
He lets them follow their own devices and be filled with the 
fruits of their own inventions.&nbsp; He lets their sinful hearts
have free course down into the depths of idolatry and 
covetousness, and filthy pleasure and mad self-conceit, that they
may learn to know the bitter fruit that springs from the accursed
root of sin, and come back to Him in shame and repentance, 
entreating Him to inform their thoughts, and guide their wills, 
and gather them to Him as a hen gathereth her chickens under her 
wing, that they may never more wander from Him, their life, their
light, and their Saviour.&nbsp; Then, sometimes, if His children 
forsake His laws and break His covenant, He visits their offences
with the rod, and their sin with the stripes of the children of 
men.&nbsp; That is, He punishes them as He punishes the heathen, 
if they sin as the heathen sin.&nbsp; He lets loose upon them His
wrath, war, disease, or scarcity, that He may drive them back to 
Him.</p>
<p>And all the while He will have them <i>labour</i>.&nbsp; He 
will make them try their strength, and use their strength, and 
improve their strength of soul and body.&nbsp; By making them 
labour, Christ teaches His people industry, order, self-command, 
self-denial, patience, courage, endurance, foresight, 
thoughtfulness, earnestness.&nbsp; All these blessed virtues come
out of holy labour; by working in welldoing we learn lessons 
which the savage among his delicious fruits and flowers, in his 
life of golden ease, and luxurious laziness, can never learn.</p>

44</span>And all this Christ teaches us because He loves us, 
because He would have us perfect.&nbsp; His love is 
unchangeable.&nbsp; As He swore by Himself that He would never 
fail David, so He has sworn that He will never fail any one of 
His Churches, or any one of us.&nbsp; Lo, said He, I am with you 
always, even to the end of the world.&nbsp; Nothing shall 
separate us from the love of Christ; neither battle nor famine, 
nor anything else in heaven or earth.&nbsp; All He wants is to 
educate us, because He loves us.&nbsp; He doth not afflict 
willingly nor grieve the children of men.&nbsp; And because He is
a God of love, He proves His love to us every now and then by 
blessing us, as well as by correcting us; else our spirits would 
fail before Him, and the souls which He has made.&nbsp; When He 
sees our adversity, He hears our complaint, He thinks upon His 
covenant and pities us, according to the multitude of His 
mercies.&nbsp; &ldquo;A fruitful land maketh He barren for the 
wickedness of them that dwell therein, yet when they cry unto the
Lord in their trouble, He delivereth them out of their 
distress.&nbsp; He maketh the wilderness standing water, and 
water springs of dry ground, and there He setteth the hungry that
they may build them a city, that they may sow their lands and 
plant vineyards, to yield them fruits of increase.&nbsp; He 
blesseth them, so that they multiply exceedingly, and suffereth 
not their cattle to decrease; and again, when they are diminished
or brought low through affliction, through any plague or trouble,
though He suffer them to be evil entreated by tyrants, and let 
them wander out of the way in the wilderness; yet helpeth He the 
poor out of misery, and maketh them households like a flock of 
sheep.&rdquo; (Ps. cvii.)</p>
<p>O my friends, have not these words ever been wonderfully 
fulfilled to some of you!&nbsp; Then see how true it is <!-- page
45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>that 
God will not always be chiding, neither keepeth He His anger for 
ever; but He knoweth our frame, He remembereth that we are but 
dust, and like as a father pitieth his children, so does He pity 
those who fear Him; and oftentimes, too, in His great 
condescension, those who fear Him not.</p>
<p>My friends, I have been trying in this sermon to make you feel
that you are under God&rsquo;s guidance, that His providence is 
trying to train and educate you.&nbsp; I have told you that there
is a blessed use and meaning in your very sorrows, and in this 
life of continual toil which God has appointed for you; I have 
told you that you ought to thank God for those sorrows: how much 
more then ought you to thank Him for your joys.&nbsp; If you 
should thank Him for want, surely you should thank Him for 
plenty.&nbsp; O thank Him earnestly&mdash;not only with your 
lips, but in your lives.&nbsp; If you believe that He has 
redeemed you with His precious blood, show your thankfulness by 
living as redeemed men, holy to God&mdash;who are not your own, 
but bought with a price; therefore show forth God&rsquo;s glory, 
the power of His grace in your bodies and your spirits which are 
His.&nbsp; If you feel that it is a noble thing to be an 
Englishman&mdash;especially an English soldier or an English 
sailor&mdash;a noble and honourable privilege to be allowed to do
your duty in the noblest nation and the noblest church which the 
world ever saw&mdash;then live as Englishmen in covenant with 
God; faithful to Him who has redeemed you and washed you from 
your sins in His own blood.&nbsp; Do you be faithful and obedient
to Christ&rsquo;s Spirit, and He will be faithful to those 
promises of His.&nbsp; Though a thousand fall at thy right hand, 
yet the evil shall not come nigh thee.&nbsp; Blessed are all they
that fear the Lord and <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>walk in His ways.&nbsp; For thou 
shalt eat the labours of thine hand.&nbsp; O well art thou and 
happy shalt thou be.&nbsp; The Lord out of heaven shall so bless 
thee, that thou shalt see England in prosperity all thy life 
long.&nbsp; Yea, thou shalt see thy children&rsquo;s children, 
and peace upon thy native land.</p>
<p>Oh, remember how God fulfilled that promise to England seventy
years ago, when the French swept in fire and slaughter, and 
horrors worse than either, over almost every nation in Europe, 
while England remained safe in peace and plenty, and an enemy 
never set foot on God&rsquo;s chosen English soil.&nbsp; Remember
the French war, and our salvation in it, and then believe and 
take comfort.&nbsp; Trust in the Lord and be doing good; dwell in
the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to
the flesh, to live after the flesh.&nbsp; For if ye live after 
the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the spirit do mortify 
the deeds of the body, ye shall live.&nbsp; For as many as are 
led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God.&nbsp; For ye 
have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye 
have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, 
Father.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Romans</span> viii. 
12-15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us try to understand these words.&nbsp; They are of quite 
infinite importance to us all.</p>
<p>We shall all agree, all of us at least who have thought at all
about right and wrong, and tried to do right and avoid 
wrong&mdash;that there goes on in us, at times, a strange 
struggle.&nbsp; We wish to do a right thing, and at the very same
time long to do a wrong one.&nbsp; We are pulled, as it were, two
different ways by two different feelings, feel as if we were two 
men at once, a better man and a worse man struggling for the 
mastery.&nbsp; One may conquer, or the other.&nbsp; We may be 
like the confirmed drunkard who cannot help draining off his 
liquor, though he knows that it is going to kill him; or we may 
be like the man who conquers his love for drink, and puts the 
liquor away, because he knows that he ought not to take it.</p>
<p>We know too well, many of us, how painful this <!-- page 
48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
48</span>inward struggle is, between our better selves, and our 
worse selves.&nbsp; How discontented with ourselves it makes us, 
how ashamed of ourselves, how angry with ourselves.&nbsp; We all 
understand too well&mdash;or ought to understand, St. 
Paul&rsquo;s words: How often the good which he wished to do, he 
did not do, but the evil which he did not wish to do, he 
did.&nbsp; How he delighted in the law of God in his inward man; 
but he found another law in him, in his body, warring against the
law of his mind&mdash;that is his conscience and reason, and 
making a slave of him till he was ready at times to cry, 
&ldquo;Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the 
body of this death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We can understand too, surely the famous parable of Plato, the
greatest of heathen philosophers, who says, that the soul of man 
is like a chariot, guided by a man&rsquo;s will, but drawn by two
horses.&nbsp; The one horse he says is white, beautiful and 
noble, well-broken and winged, too, always trying to rise and fly
upward with the chariot toward heaven.&nbsp; But the other horse 
is black, evil, and unmanageable, always trying to rush downward,
and drag the chariot and the driver into hell.</p>
<p>Ah my friends, that is but too true a picture of most of us, 
and God grant that in our souls the better horse may win, that 
our nobler and purer desires may lift us up, and leave behind 
those lower and fouler desires which try to drag us down.&nbsp; 
But to drag us down whither?&nbsp; To hell at last, says Plato 
the heathen.&nbsp; To destruction and death in the meanwhile, 
says St. Paul.</p>
<p>Now in the text St. Paul explains this struggle&mdash;this 
continual war which goes on within us.&nbsp; He says that there 
are two parts in us&mdash;the flesh and the spirit&mdash;and that
the flesh lusts, that is, longs and struggles to have <!-- page 
49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>its 
own way against the spirit, and the spirit against the 
flesh.&nbsp; First, there is a flesh in us&mdash;that is, a 
carnal animal nature.&nbsp; Of that there can be no doubt: we are
animals, we come into the world as animals do&mdash;eat, drink, 
sleep as they do&mdash;have the same passions as they 
have&mdash;and our carnal mortal bodies die at last, exactly as 
the animals die.</p>
<p>But are we nothing more?&nbsp; God forbid.&nbsp; St. Paul 
tells us that we are something more&mdash;and our own conscience 
and reason tell us that we are something more.&nbsp; We know that
to be a man, we must be something more than an animal&mdash;a 
mere brute&mdash;for when we call any one a brute, what do we 
mean?&nbsp; That he has lost his humanity, his sense of justice, 
mercy, and decency, and given himself up to his flesh&mdash;his 
animal nature, till the <i>man</i> in him is dead, and only the 
<i>brute</i> remains.&nbsp; Mind, I do not say that we are right 
in calling any human being a brute, for no one, I believe, is 
sunk so low, but there is some spark of humanity, some spark of 
what St. Paul calls &ldquo;the spirit,&rdquo; left in him, which 
may be fanned into a flame and conquer, and raise and save the 
man at last&mdash;unless he be a mere idiot&mdash;or that most 
unhappy and brutal of all beings, a confirmed drunkard.</p>
<p>But our giving way to the same selfish shameless passions, 
which we see in the lower animals, is letting the 
&ldquo;brute&rdquo; in us conquer, is giving way to the works of 
the flesh.&nbsp; The shameless and profligate person gives way to
the &ldquo;brute&rdquo; within him&mdash;the man who beats his 
wife&mdash;or ill-treats his children&mdash;or in any wise 
tyrannises over those who are weaker than himself, he too gives 
way to the &ldquo;brute&rdquo; within him.&nbsp; He who grudges, 
envies, tries to aggrandise himself at his neighbour&rsquo;s 
expense&mdash;he too <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>gives way to the &ldquo;brute&rdquo; 
within him, and puts on the likeness of the dog which snatches 
and snarls over his bone.&nbsp; He who spends his life in cunning
plots and mean tricks, stealthy, crafty, silent, false, he gives 
way to the &ldquo;brute&rdquo; in him, just as much as the fox or
ferret.&nbsp; And those, let me say, who without giving way to 
those grosser vices, let their minds be swallowed up with vanity,
love of admiration, always longing to be seen and looked at, and 
wondering what folks will say of them, they too give way to the 
flesh, and lower themselves to the likeness of animals.&nbsp; As 
vain as a peacock, says the old proverb.&nbsp; And shame it is to
any human being so far to forget his true humanity, as to have 
that said of him.&nbsp; And what shall we say of them who like 
the swine live only for eating and drinking, and enjoyment?&nbsp;
Or what of those who like the butterflies spend all their time in
frivolous amusement, fluttering in the sunshine, silly and 
helpless, without a sense of duty or usefulness, without 
forethought for the coming frosts of winter, against which their 
gay feathers would be no protection?&nbsp; Do not all these in 
some way or other give way to the animal within them, and live 
after the flesh?&nbsp; And do they not, all of them, of the 
flesh, reap corruption, and fulfil St. Paul&rsquo;s words, 
&ldquo;If ye live after the flesh ye shall die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But some one will say&mdash;&ldquo;Die?&mdash;of course we 
shall all die&mdash;good and bad alike.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is it so, my
friends?&nbsp; Then why does our Lord say, &ldquo;He that liveth 
and believeth in me shall never die?&rdquo;&nbsp; And why does 
St. Paul say, &ldquo;If ye through the spirit do mortify,&rdquo; 
that is crush, and as it were kill, &ldquo;the deeds of the 
body,&rdquo; all those low animal passions and vices, &ldquo;ye 
shall live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us look at the text again.&nbsp; &ldquo;If ye live after 
the <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
51</span>flesh ye shall die.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you give way to 
those animal passions and vices&mdash;low and cruel&mdash;or even
merely selfish and frivolous, you shall die; not merely your 
bodies&mdash;they will die in any case&mdash;the animals 
do&mdash;for animals they are, and as animals die they 
must.&nbsp; But over and above that&mdash;you yourselves shall 
die&mdash;your character will die, your manhood or your womanhood
will die, your immortal soul will die.&nbsp; The likeness of God 
in you will die.&nbsp; Oh, my friends, there is a second death to
which that first death of the body is a mere trivial and harmless
accident&mdash;the death of sin which kills the true man and true
woman within you.&nbsp; And that second death may begin in this 
life, and if it be not stopped and cured in time, may go on for 
ever.&nbsp; The black horse of which I spoke just now, may get 
the mastery and drag us down, down, into bogs out of which we can
never rise&mdash;over cliffs which we can never climb 
again&mdash;down lower and lower&mdash;more and more foolish, 
more and more reckless, more and more base, more and more 
wretched.&nbsp; And then there will be no more use in saying, 
&ldquo;The Lord have mercy on my soul,&rdquo; for we shall have 
no soul left to have mercy on.</p>
<p>This is the dark side of the matter&mdash;a very dark one: but
it has to be spoken of, because it is true; and what is more, it 
comes true only too often in this world.&nbsp; God grant, my dear
friends, that it may not come true of any of you.</p>
<p>But there is also a bright side to the matter&mdash;and on 
that I will speak now, in order that this sermon may end, as such
gospel sermons surely should end, not with threats and fear, but 
with hope and comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the 
body, ye shall live.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you will be true to your 
better <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>selves, if you will listen to, and 
obey the spirit of God, when He puts into your hearts good 
desires, and makes you long to be just and true, pure and sober, 
kind and useful.&nbsp; If you will cast away and trample under 
foot animal passions, low vices, you shall live.&nbsp; <i>You</i>
shall live.&nbsp; Your very soul and self shall live, and live 
for ever.&nbsp; Your humanity, your human nature shall 
live.&nbsp; All that is humane in you shall live.&nbsp; All that 
is merciful and kind in you, all that is pure and graceful, all 
that is noble and generous, all that is useful.&nbsp; All in you 
that is pleasant to yourselves shall live.&nbsp; All in you that 
is pleasant to your neighbours.&nbsp; All in you that is pleasant
to God shall live.&nbsp; In one word, all in you that is like 
Christ&mdash;all in you that is like God&mdash;all in you that is
spirit and not flesh, shall live, and live for ever.&nbsp; So it 
must be, for what says St. Paul?&nbsp; &ldquo;As many as are led 
by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Those who let the spirit of God lead them upward instead of 
letting their own animal nature drag them downward, they are the 
sons of God.&nbsp; And how can a son of God perish?&nbsp; How can
that which is like God and like Christ perish?&nbsp; How can he 
perish, who like Christ is full of the fruits of the spirit? of 
love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 
meekness, temperance?&nbsp; The world did not give them to him, 
and the world cannot take them from him.&nbsp; They were not 
bestowed on him at his bodily birth&mdash;neither shall they be 
taken from him at his bodily death&mdash;for those blessed fruits
of the spirit belong neither to the flesh nor to the world, but 
to Christ&rsquo;s spirit, and to heaven&mdash;to that heaven in 
which they dwell before the throne of God&mdash;yea, rather in 
the mind of God Himself, the eternal forms of the truth, the 
beauty, the goodness&mdash;<!-- page 53--><a 
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>which were 
before all worlds&mdash;and shall be after all worlds have passed
away.</p>
<p>Oh! choose my friends, especially you who are young and 
entering into life.&nbsp; Remember the parable of the old 
heathen, about the two horses who draw your soul.&nbsp; Choose in
time whether the better horse shall win, or the worse; whether 
your better self, or your worse, the Spirit of God or your own 
flesh, shall be your master&mdash;whether you will rise step by 
step to heaven, or sink step by step to death and hell?&nbsp; And
let no one tell you.&nbsp; That is not the question.&nbsp; That 
is not what we care about.&nbsp; We know we shall do a great many
wrong things before we die.&nbsp; Every one does that; but we 
hope we shall be able to make our peace with God before we die, 
and so be forgiven at last.</p>
<p>My dear friends, that kind of religion has done more harm than
most kinds of <i>irreligion</i>.&nbsp; It tells you to take your 
chance of beginning at the end&mdash;that is just before you 
die.&nbsp; Common sense tells you that the only way to get to the
end, is by beginning at the beginning, which is <i>now</i>.&nbsp;
Now is the accepted time.&nbsp; <i>Now</i> is the day of 
salvation, and you are accepted now, already, long ago.</p>
<p>What do you or any man want with making your peace with 
God?&nbsp; You are at peace with God already.&nbsp; He has made 
His peace with you.&nbsp; An infinitely better peace than any 
priest or preacher can make for you.&nbsp; <i>You are God&rsquo;s
child</i>.&nbsp; He looks down on you with boundless love.&nbsp; 
The great heart of Christ, your King, your Redeemer, your elder 
brother, yearns over you with boundless longing to draw you up to
Him, that you may be noble as He is noble, pure as He is pure, 
loving as He is loving, just as He is just.&nbsp; Try to be 
that.&nbsp; God will <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>at the last day take you as He finds 
you.&nbsp; Let Him find you such as <i>that</i>&mdash;walking not
after the flesh, but after the Spirit; and then, and then only, 
there will be no condemnation for you, for you will be in Christ 
Jesus.&nbsp; Do not&mdash;do not talk about making your peace 
with God some day&mdash;like a naughty child playing truant till 
the last moment, and hoping that the schoolmaster may forget to 
punish it.&nbsp; No, I trust you have received the Spirit.&nbsp; 
If you have, then look facts in the face.&nbsp; I trust that none
of you have received the Spirit of bondage, which is slavery 
again unto fear.&nbsp; If you have God&rsquo;s Spirit you will 
see who you are, and where you are, and act accordingly&mdash;you
will see that you <i>are</i> God&rsquo;s children, who are meant 
to be educated by the Son of God, and led by the Spirit of God, 
and raised day by day, year by year, from the death of sin, to 
the life of righteousness, from the likeness of the brute animal,
to the likeness of Christ, the Son of Man!</p>
<h2><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
55</span>VIII.&nbsp; ST. PETER; OR, TRUE COURAGE.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and
John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, 
they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had 
been with Jesus.&nbsp; And they called them, and commanded them 
not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.&nbsp; But 
Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right 
in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge
ye.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Acts</span> iv. 13, 18, 
19.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that the quality, the grace of God, which St. 
Peter&rsquo;s character and story specially forces on our notice 
is courage&mdash;the true courage which comes by faith.&nbsp; The
courage which comes by faith, I say.&nbsp; There is a courage 
which does not come by faith.&nbsp; There is a brute courage 
which comes from hardness of heart; from obstinacy, or anger, or 
stupidity, which does not see danger, or does not feel 
pain.&nbsp; That is the courage of the brute.&nbsp; One does not 
blame it or call it wrong.&nbsp; It is good in its place, as all 
natural things are which God has made.&nbsp; It is good enough 
for the brute; but it is not good enough for man.&nbsp; You 
cannot trust it in man.&nbsp; And the more a man is what a man 
should be, the less he can trust it.&nbsp; The more mind and 
understanding a man has, so as to be able to foresee danger and 
measure it, the more chance there is of his brute courage giving 
way.&nbsp; The more feeling a man has, the more keen he is to 
feel pain of body, or pain of mind, such as shame, loneliness, 
<!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
56</span>the dislike of ridicule, and the contempt of his 
fellow-men; in a word, the more of a man he is, the more chance 
there is of his brute courage breaking down, just when he wants 
it more to keep him up, and leaving him to play the coward and 
come to shame.</p>
<p>Yes; to go through with a difficult or dangerous undertaking a
man wants more than brute courage.&nbsp; He wants spiritual 
courage, the courage which comes by faith.&nbsp; He needs to have
faith in what he is doing to be certain that he is doing his 
duty&mdash;to be certain that he is in the right.&nbsp; To give 
one example.&nbsp; Look at the class of men who in all England in
times of peace undergo the most fearful dangers; who know not at 
what hour of any night they may not be called up to the most 
serious and hard labour and responsibility, with the chance of a 
horrible and torturing death.&nbsp; I mean the firemen of our 
great cities, than whom there are no steadier, braver, 
nobler-hearted men.&nbsp; Not a week passes without one or more 
of those firemen, in trying to save life and property, doing 
things which are altogether heroic.&nbsp; What do you fancy keeps
them up to their work?&nbsp; High pay?&nbsp; The amusement and 
excitement of the fires?&nbsp; The vanity of being praised for 
their courage?&nbsp; My friends, those would be but weak and 
paltry motives, which would not keep a man&rsquo;s heart calm and
his head clear under such responsibility and danger as 
theirs.</p>
<p>No; it is the sense of duty.&nbsp; The knowledge that they are
doing a good and a noble work in saving the lives of human beings
and the wealth of the nation&mdash;the knowledge that they are in
God&rsquo;s hands, and that no evil can happen to him who is 
doing right&mdash;that to him even death at his post is not a 
loss, but a gain.&nbsp; In short, faith in God, more or less 
clear, is what gives <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>those men their strong and quiet 
courage.&nbsp; God grant that you and I, if ever we have 
dangerous work to do, may get true courage from the same fountain
of ghostly strength.</p>
<p>Yes; it is the courage which comes by faith which makes truly 
brave men, men like St. Peter and St. John, who can say, 
&ldquo;If I am right, God is on my side, I will not fear what men
can do unto me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not fear,&rdquo; said 
David, &ldquo;though the earth be moved, and the mountains 
carried into the midst of the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; The just man who 
holds firm to his duty will not, says a wise old writer, 
&ldquo;be shaken from his solid mind by the rage of the mob 
bidding him do base things, or the frown of the tyrant who 
persecutes him.&nbsp; Though the world were to crumble to pieces 
round him, its ruins would strike him without making him 
tremble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such courage has made men, shut up in prison for long weary 
years for doing what was right, endure manfully for the sake of 
some great cause, and say&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Stone walls do not a prison make,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor iron bars a cage,<br />
Minds innocent and quiet take<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That for an hermitage.<br />
If I have freedom in my thought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in my soul am free,<br />
Angels alone that soar above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enjoy such liberty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes; settle it in your hearts, all of you.&nbsp; There is but 
one thing you have to fear in heaven or earth&mdash;being untrue 
to your better selves, and therefore untrue to God.&nbsp; If you 
will not do the thing you know to be right, and say the thing you
know to be true, then indeed you are weak.&nbsp; You are a 
coward, and sin against God.&nbsp; <!-- page 58--><a 
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>And you will 
suffer the penalty of your cowardice.&nbsp; You desert God, and 
therefore you cannot expect Him to stand by you.&nbsp; But who 
will harm you if you be followers of that which is right?</p>
<p>What does David say:&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, who shall abide in thy
tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?&nbsp; He that 
walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the 
truth in his heart.&nbsp; He that backbiteth not with his tongue,
nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against
his neighbour.&nbsp; In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; 
but he honoureth them that fear the Lord.&nbsp; He that sweareth 
to his own hurt, and changeth not.&nbsp; He that putteth not out 
his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent.&nbsp;
He that doeth these things shall never be 
moved.&rdquo;&mdash;Psalm xv. 1-5.&nbsp; Yes, my friends, there 
is a tabernacle of God in which, even in this life, He will hide 
us from strife.&nbsp; There is a hill of God in which, even in 
the midst of danger, and labour, and anxiety, we may rest both 
day and night&mdash;even Jesus Christ, the Rock of Ages&mdash;He 
who is the righteousness itself, the truth itself.&nbsp; And 
whosoever does righteousness and speaks truth, dwells in Christ 
in this life, as well as in the life to come.&nbsp; And Christ 
will give him courage to strengthen him by His Holy Spirit, to 
stand in the evil day, the day of danger, if it shall 
come&mdash;and having done all to stand.</p>
<p>Pray you then for the Spirit of Faith to believe really in 
God, and for the spirit of ghostly strength to obey God 
honestly.&nbsp; No man ever asked honestly for that Spirit but 
what he gained it at last.&nbsp; And no man ever gained it but 
what he found the truth of St. Peter&rsquo;s own 
words&mdash;&ldquo;Who will harm you, if you be followers of what
is good?&rdquo;</p>

59</span>IX.&nbsp; THE STORY OF JOSEPH.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I fear God.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Genesis</span> xlii. 18.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did it ever seem remarkable to you, as it has seemed to me, 
how many chapters of the Bible are taken up with the history of 
Joseph&mdash;a young man who, on the most memorable occasion in 
his life, said &ldquo;I fear God,&rdquo; and had no other 
argument to use?</p>
<p>Thirteen chapters of the book of Genesis are mainly devoted to
the tale of this one young man.&nbsp; Doubtless his father 
Jacob&rsquo;s going down into Egypt, was one of the most 
important events in the history of the Jews: we might expect, 
therefore, to hear much about it.&nbsp; But what need was there 
to spend four chapters at least in detailing Joseph&rsquo;s 
meeting with his brethren, even to minute accounts of the 
speeches on both sides?</p>
<p>Those who will may suppose that this is the effect of mere 
chance.&nbsp; Let us have no such fancy.&nbsp; If we believe that
a Divine Providence watched over the composition of those old 
Scriptures; if we believe that they were meant to teach, not only
the Jews but all mankind; if we believe that they reveal, not 
merely some special God in whom the Jews believed, but the true 
and only God, Maker of heaven and earth; if we believe, with St. 
Paul, that every book of the Old Testament is inspired by God, 
and profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, <!-- 
page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
60</span>for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God 
may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works&mdash;if
we believe this, I say, it must be worth our while to look 
carefully and reverently at a story which takes up so large a 
part of the Bible, and expect to find in it something which may 
help to make <i>us</i> perfect, and thoroughly furnish <i>us</i> 
unto all good works.</p>
<p>Now, surely when we look at this history of Joseph, we ought 
to see at the first glance that it is not merely a story about a 
young man, but about the common human relations&mdash;the ties 
which bind any and every man to other human beings round 
him.&nbsp; For is it not a story about a brother and brothers? 
about a son and a father, about a master and a servant? about a 
husband and a wife? about a subject and a sovereign? and how they
all behaved to each other&mdash;some well and some ill&mdash;in 
these relations?</p>
<p>Surely it is so, and surely this is why the story of Joseph 
has been always so popular among innocent children and plain 
honest folk of all kinds; because it is so simply human and 
humane; and therefore it taught them far more than they could 
learn from many a lofty, or seemingly lofty, book of devotion, 
when it spoke to them of the very duties they had to fulfil, and 
the very temptations they had to fight against, as members of a 
family or as members of society.&nbsp; &ldquo;One touch of Nature
(says the poet) makes the whole world kin;&rdquo; and the touches
of nature in this story of Joseph make us feel that he and his 
brethren, and all with whom he had to do, are indeed kin to us; 
that their duty is our duty too&mdash;their temptations 
ours&mdash;that where they fell, we may fall&mdash;where they 
conquered we may conquer.</p>
<p>For what is the story?&nbsp; A young lad is thrown into <!-- 
page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
61</span>every temptation possible for him.&nbsp; Joseph is very 
handsome.&nbsp; The Bible says so expressly; so we may believe 
it.&nbsp; He has every gift of body and mind.&nbsp; He is, as his
story proves plainly, a very clever person, with a strange power 
of making every one whom he deals with love him and obey 
him&mdash;a terrible temptation, as all God&rsquo;s gifts are, if
abused by a man&rsquo;s vanity, or covetousness or 
ambition.&nbsp; He is an injured man too.&nbsp; He has been 
basely betrayed by his brothers; he is under a terrible 
temptation, to which ninety-nine men out of one hundred would 
have yielded&mdash;do yield, alas! to this day, to revenge 
himself if he ever has an opportunity.&nbsp; He is an injured man
in Egypt, for he is a slave to a foreigner who has no legal or 
moral right over him.&nbsp; If ever there was a man who might be 
excused for cherishing a burning indignation against his 
oppressors, for brooding over his own wrongs, for despairing of 
God&rsquo;s providence, it is Joseph in Egypt.&nbsp; What could 
we do but pity him if he had said to himself, as thousands in his
place have said since, &ldquo;There is no God, or if there is, He
does not care for me&mdash;He does not care what men do.&nbsp; He
looks on unmoved at wrong and cruelty, and lets man do even as he
will.&nbsp; Then why should not <i>I</i> do as <i>I</i> 
will?&nbsp; What are these laws of God of which men talk?&nbsp; 
What are these sacred bonds of family and society?&nbsp; Every 
one for himself is the rule of the world, and it shall be 
<i>my</i> rule.&nbsp; Every man&rsquo;s hand has been against 
<i>me</i>; why should not my hand be against every man?&nbsp; 
<i>I</i> have been betrayed; why should not <i>I</i> 
betray?&nbsp; <i>I</i> have been opprest; why should not <i>I</i>
oppress?&nbsp; I have a lucky chance, too, of enjoying and 
revenging myself at the same time; why should I not take my good 
luck, and listen to the words of the tempter?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
62</span>My dear friends, this is the way in which thousands have
talked, in which thousands talk to this day.&nbsp; This is the 
spirit which ends in breaking up society, as happened in France 
eighty years ago, in the inward corruption of a nation, and at 
last, in outward revolution and anarchy, from which may God in 
His mercy deliver us and our fellow-countrymen, and the 
generations yet to come.&nbsp; But any nation or any man, will 
only be delivered from it, as Joseph was delivered from it, by 
saying, &ldquo;I fear God.&rdquo;&nbsp; No doubt it is most 
natural for a man who is injured and opprest to think in that 
way.&nbsp; Most <i>natural</i>&mdash;just as it is most natural 
for the trapped dog to struggle vainly, and, in his blind rage, 
bite at everything around him, even at his own master&rsquo;s 
hand when it offers to set him free.&nbsp; And if men are to be 
mere children of nature, like the animals, and not children of 
grace and sons of God, like Joseph, and like one greater than 
Joseph, then I suppose they must needs tear each other to pieces 
in envy and revenge, for there is nought better to be done.&nbsp;
But if they wish to escape from the misery and ruin which envy 
and revenge bring with them, then they had better recollect that 
they are not children of nature, but children of God&mdash;they 
had best follow Joseph&rsquo;s example, and say, &ldquo;I fear 
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For this poor, betrayed, enslaved lad had got into his heart 
something above Nature&mdash;something which Nature cannot give, 
but only the inspiration of the Spirit of God gives.&nbsp; He had
got into his heart the belief that God&rsquo;s laws were sacred 
things and must not be broken, and that whatever befel him he 
must fear God.&nbsp; However unjust and lawless the world looked,
God&rsquo;s laws were still in it, and over it, and would avenge 
themselves, <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>and he must obey them at all 
risks.&nbsp; And what were God&rsquo;s laws in Joseph&rsquo;s 
opinion?</p>
<p>These&mdash;the common relations of humanity between master to
servant, and servant to master; between parent to child, and 
child to parent; brother to brother and sister to sister, and 
between the man who is trusted and the man who trusts him.&nbsp; 
These laws were sacred; and if all the rest of the world broke 
them, he (Joseph) must not.&nbsp; He was bound to his master, not
only by any law of man, but by the Law of God.&nbsp; His master 
trusted him, and left all that he had in his hand, and to Joseph 
the law of honour was the law of God.&nbsp; Then he must be 
justly faithful to his master.&nbsp; A sacred trust was laid on 
him, and to be true to it was to fear God.</p>
<p>After a while his master&rsquo;s wife tempts him.&nbsp; He 
refuses; not merely out of honour to his master, but from fear of
God.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can I do this great wickedness,&rdquo; says
Joseph, &ldquo;and sin against God?&rdquo;&nbsp; His master and 
his mistress are heathen, but their marriage is of God 
nevertheless; the vow is sacred, and he must deny himself 
anything, endure anything, dare any danger of a dreadful death, 
and a prison almost as horrible probably as death itself, rather 
than break it.</p>
<p>So again, in the prison.&nbsp; If ever man had excuse for 
despairing of God&rsquo;s providence, for believing that 
right-doing did <i>not</i> pay, it was poor Joseph in that 
prison.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; God is with him still.&nbsp; He 
believes still in the justice of God, the providence of God, and 
therefore he is cheerful, active&mdash;he can make the best even 
of a dungeon.&nbsp; He can find a duty to do even there; he can 
make himself useful, helpful, till the keeper of the prison too 
leaves everything in his hand.</p>
<p>What a gallant man! you say.&nbsp; Yes, my friends, but <!-- 
page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
64</span>what makes him gallant?&nbsp; That which St. Paul says 
(in Hebrews xi.) made all the old Jewish heroes 
gallant&mdash;faith in God; real and living belief that God 
is&mdash;and that He is the rewarder of them that diligently seek
Him.</p>
<p>At last Joseph&rsquo;s triumph comes.&nbsp; He has his 
reward.&nbsp; God helps him&mdash;because he will help 
himself.&nbsp; He is made a great officer of state, married to a 
woman of high rank, probably a princess, and he sees his brothers
who betrayed him at his mercy.&nbsp; Their lives are in his hand 
at last.&nbsp; What will he do?&nbsp; Will he be a bad brother 
because they were bad?&nbsp; Or will he keep to his old 
watchword, &ldquo;I fear God?&rdquo;&nbsp; If he is tempted to 
revenge himself, he crushes the temptation down.&nbsp; He will 
bring his brothers to repentance.&nbsp; He will touch their 
inward witness, and make them feel that they have been wicked 
men.&nbsp; That is for their good.&nbsp; And strangely, but most 
naturally, their guilty consciences go back to the great sin of 
their lives&mdash;to Joseph&rsquo;s wrong, though they have no 
notion that Joseph is alive, much less near them.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Did I not tell you,&rdquo; says Reuben, &ldquo;sin not 
against the lad, and ye would not hearken?&nbsp; Therefore is 
this distress come upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph punishes Simeon by imprisonment.&nbsp; It may be that 
he had reasons for it which we are not told.&nbsp; But when his 
brothers have endured the trial, and he finds that Benjamin is 
safe, he has nothing left but forgiveness.&nbsp; They are his 
brethren still&mdash;his own flesh and blood.&nbsp; And he 
&ldquo;fears God.&rdquo;&nbsp; He dare not do anything but 
forgive them.&nbsp; He forgives them utterly, and welcomes them 
with an agony of happy tears.&nbsp; He will even put out of their
minds the very memory of their baseness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, 
therefore, be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold 
me hither, he says; for God <!-- page 65--><a 
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>sent me 
before you, to save your lives with a great 
deliverance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is not that Divine?&nbsp; Is not that the Spirit of God and of
Christ?&nbsp; I say it is.&nbsp; For what is it but the likeness 
of Christ, who says for ever, out of heaven, to all mankind, 
&ldquo;Be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye crucified
me.&nbsp; For God, my Father, sent me to save your souls by a 
great salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friends, learn from this story of Joseph, and the prominent
place in the Bible which it occupies&mdash;learn, I say, how 
hateful to God are family quarrels; how pleasant to God are 
family unity and peace, and mutual trust, and duty, and 
helpfulness.&nbsp; And if you think that I speak too strongly on 
this point, recollect that I do no more than St. Paul does, when 
he sums up the most lofty and mystical of all his Epistles, the 
Epistle to the Ephesians, by simple commands to husbands and 
wives, parents and children, masters and servants, as if he 
should say,&mdash;You wish to be holy? you wish to be 
spiritual?&nbsp; Then fulfil these plain family duties, for they,
too, are sacred and divine, and he who despises them, despises 
the ordinances of God.&nbsp; And if you despise the laws of God, 
they will surely avenge themselves on you.&nbsp; If you are bad 
husbands or bad wives, bad parents or bad children, bad brothers 
or sisters, bad masters or servants, you will smart for it, 
according to the eternal laws of God, which are at work around 
you all day long, making the sinner punish himself whether he 
likes or not.</p>
<p>Examine yourselves&mdash;ask yourselves, each of you, Have I 
been a good brother? have I been a good son? have I been a good 
husband? have I been a good father? have I been a good 
servant?&nbsp; If not, all professions of religion will avail me 
nothing.&nbsp; If not, let me <!-- page 66--><a 
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>confess my 
sins to God, and repent and amend at once, whatever it may cost 
me.&nbsp; The fulfilling these plain duties is the true test of 
my faith, the true sign and test whether I really believe in God 
and in Jesus Christ our Lord.&nbsp; Do I believe that the world 
is Christ&rsquo;s making? and that Christ is governing it?&nbsp; 
Do I believe that these plain family relationships are 
Christ&rsquo;s sacred appointments?&nbsp; Do I believe that our 
Lord Jesus was made very man of the substance of His mother, to 
sanctify these family relationships, and claim them as the 
ordinances of God His Father?</p>
<p>In one word&mdash;copy Joseph; and when you are tempted say 
with Joseph, &ldquo;Can I do this great wickedness, and 
sin&mdash;not against this man or this woman, but 
against&mdash;<i>God</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Take home these plain, practical words.&nbsp; Take them home, 
and fear God at your own firesides.&nbsp; For at the last day, 
the Bible tells us, the Lord Jesus Christ will not reward you and
me according to the opinions we held while in this mortal body, 
whether they were quite right or quite wrong, but according to 
the deeds which we did in the body, whether they were good or 
bad.</p>

<p>Why did God bring the Jews out of Egypt?&nbsp; God Himself 
told them why.&nbsp; To fulfil the promise which He made to 
Abraham, their forefather, that of his children He would make a 
great nation.</p>
<p>Now the Jews in Egypt were not a nation at all.&nbsp; A nation
is free, governed by its own laws, one body of people, held 
together by one fellow feeling, one language, one blood, one 
religion; as we English are.&nbsp; We are a nation.&nbsp; The 
Jews were none in Egypt, no more than Negro slaves in America 
were a nation.&nbsp; They served a people of a different blood, 
as the Jews did in Egypt.&nbsp; They had no laws of their own; 
they had no fellow-feeling with each other, which enabled them to
make common cause together, and help each other, and free each 
other.</p>
<p>Selfishness and cowardice make some men slaves.&nbsp; Above 
all, ungodliness makes men slaves.&nbsp; For when men do not fear
and obey God, they are sure to obey their own lusts and passions,
and become slaves to them.&nbsp; They become ready to sell 
themselves soul and body for money, <!-- page 68--><a 
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>or pleasure, 
or food.&nbsp; And their fleshly lusts, their animal appetites, 
keep them down, selfish, divided, greedy, and needy, at the mercy
of those who are stronger and cunninger than themselves, just as 
the Jews were kept down by the strong and cunning Egyptians.</p>
<p>They had slavish hearts in them, and as long as they had, God 
could not make them into a nation.&nbsp; The Jews <i>had</i> 
slaves&rsquo; hearts in them.&nbsp; They were glad enough to get 
free out of Egypt, to escape from their heavy labour in brick and
mortar, from being oppressed, beaten, killed at the will and 
fancy of the Egyptians, from having their male children thrown 
into the river as soon as they were born, to keep them from 
becoming too numerous.&nbsp; They were glad enough, poor 
wretches, to escape from all their misery and oppression of which
we read in the first three chapters of Exodus.&nbsp; But if they 
could do that, that was all they cared for.&nbsp; They did not 
want to be made wise, righteous, strong, free-hearted&mdash;they 
did not care about being made into a nation.&nbsp; We read that 
when by the Red Sea shore (Exodus xiv.), they saw themselves in 
great danger, the army of Pharaoh, King of Egypt, following close
upon them to attack them, they lost heart at once, and were sore 
afraid, and cried unto Moses, &ldquo;Is not this the word which 
we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone that we may serve
the Egyptians?&nbsp; For it had been better for us to serve the 
Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cowards and slaves!&nbsp; The thing they feared above all, you
see, was death.&nbsp; If they could but keep the miserable life 
in their miserable bodies, they cared for nothing beyond.&nbsp; 
They were willing to see their children taken from them and 
murdered, willing to be beaten, worked like dumb beasts for other
men&rsquo;s profit, willing to be <!-- page 69--><a 
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>idolaters, 
heathens, worshipping the false gods of Egypt, dumb beasts and 
stocks and stones, willing to be despised, wretched, helpless 
slaves&mdash;if they could but keep the dear life in them.&nbsp; 
God knows there are plenty like them now-a-days&mdash;plenty who 
do not care how mean, helpless, wicked, contemptible they are, if
they can but get their living by their meanness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>But a man must live</i>,&rdquo; says some one.&nbsp;
How often one hears that made the excuse for all sorts of 
meanness, dishonesty, grasping tyranny.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>A man 
must live</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Who told you that?&nbsp; It is better
to die like a man than to live like a slave, and a wretch, and a 
sinner.&nbsp; Who told you that, I ask again?&nbsp; Not 
God&rsquo;s Bible, surely.&nbsp; Not the example of great and 
good men.&nbsp; If Moses had thought that, do you think he would 
have gone back from Midian, when he was in safety and comfort, 
with a wife and home, and children at his knee, and leave all he 
had on earth to face Pharaoh and the Egyptians, to face danger, 
perhaps a cruel death in shame and torture, and all to deliver 
his countrymen out of Egypt?&nbsp; Moses would sooner die like a 
man helping his countrymen, than live on the fat of the land 
while they were slaves.&nbsp; And forty years before he had shown
the same spirit too, when though he was rich and prosperous, and 
high in the world, the adopted son of King Pharaoh&rsquo;s 
daughter (Exodus ii. 11), he disdained to be a slave and to see 
his countrymen slaves round him.&nbsp; We read how he killed an 
Egyptian, who was ill-treating one of his brothers, the 
Jews&mdash;and how he then fled out of Egypt into Midian, 
houseless and friendless, esteeming as St. Paul says, &ldquo;the 
reproach of Christ&rdquo;&mdash;that is the affliction and 
ill-will which came on him for doing right, &ldquo;better than 
all the treasures of Egypt&rdquo; (Heb xi. 24-27).</p>
<p><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
70</span><i>A man must live</i>?&nbsp; The valiant Tyrolese of 
old did not say that (more than seventy years ago), when they 
fought to the last drop of their blood to defend their country 
against the French invaders.&nbsp; They were not afraid to die 
for liberty; and therefore they won honour from all honourable 
men, praise from all whose praise is worth having for ever.</p>
<p><i>A man must live</i>?&nbsp; The old Greeks and Romans, 
heathens though they were, were above so mean a speech as 
that.&nbsp; They used to say, it was the noblest thing that can 
befall a man to die&mdash;not to live in clover, eating and 
drinking at his ease&mdash;to die among the foremost, fighting 
for wife and child and home.</p>
<p><i>A man must live</i>?&nbsp; The martyrs of old did not say 
that, when they endured the prison and the scourge, the sword and
the fire, and chose rather to die in torments unspeakable than 
deny the Lord Jesus who bought them with His blood, rather than 
do what they knew to be <i>wrong</i>. (Hebrews xi.)&nbsp; They 
were not afraid of torture and death; but of doing wrong they 
were unspeakably afraid.&nbsp; They were <i>free</i>, those holy 
men of old, truly free&mdash;free from their own love of ease and
cowardice and selfishness, and all that drags a man down and 
makes a slave of him.&nbsp; They knew that &ldquo;life is more 
than meat, and the body more than raiment.&rdquo;&nbsp; What 
matter if a man gain the whole world and lose his own soul?&nbsp;
Their souls were free whatever happened to their bodies&mdash;the
tormentor could not touch <i>them</i>, because they believed in 
God, because they did not fear those who could kill the body, and
after that had no more that they could do.</p>
<p>And do you not see that a coward can never be free, never be 
godly, never be like Christ?&nbsp; For by a coward <!-- page 
71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>I 
mean not merely a man who is afraid of pain and trouble.&nbsp; 
Every one is that more or less.&nbsp; Jesus Himself was afraid 
when He cried in agony, &ldquo;Father, if thou be willing, remove
this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be 
done.&rdquo; (Luke xxii. 42.)&nbsp; But a coward is a man who is 
so much afraid that to escape pain and danger, he will do what he
<i>ought not</i>&mdash;do what he is ashamed of doing&mdash;do 
what lowers him; and therefore our Lord Jesus had perfect courage
when He tasted death for all men, and endured the very agony from
which He shrank, and while He said, &ldquo;Father, if it be 
possible, let this cup pass,&rdquo; said also, 
&ldquo;Nevertheless not my will, but Thine, be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jews were cowards when they cried, &ldquo;Let us alone 
that we may serve the Egyptians.&rdquo;&nbsp; While a man is in 
that pitiful mood he cannot rise, he cannot serve God&mdash;for 
he must remain the slave of his own body, of which he is so 
mightily careful, the slave of his own fears, the slave of his 
own love of bodily comfort.&nbsp; Such a man does not <i>dare</i>
serve God.&nbsp; He dare not obey God, when obeying God is 
dangerous and unpleasant.&nbsp; He dare not claim his heavenly 
birthright, his share in God&rsquo;s Spirit, his share in 
Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, because that would bring discomfort on 
him, because he will have to give up the sins he loves, because 
he will have to endure the insults and ill-will of wicked 
men.&nbsp; Thus cowards can never be free, for it is only where 
the Spirit of God is that there is liberty.</p>
<p>But the Jews were not yet fit to be made soldiers of.&nbsp; 
God would not teach them at once not to be afraid of men.&nbsp; 
He did not command them to turn again and fight these Egyptians, 
neither did He lead them into the land of Canaan the strait and 
short road, through the <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>country of the Philistines, lest they
should be discouraged when they saw war.</p>
<p>Now what was God&rsquo;s plan for raising the Jews out of this
cowardly, slavish state?&nbsp; First, and above all, to make them
trust in <i>Him</i>.&nbsp; While they were fearing the Egyptians,
they could never fear Him.&nbsp; While they were fearing the 
Egyptians, they were ready to do every base thing, to keep their 
masters in good humour with them.&nbsp; God determined to teach 
them to fear Him more than they feared the Egyptians.&nbsp; God 
taught them that He was stronger than the Egyptians, for all 
their civilisation and learning and armies, chariots and 
horsemen, swords and spears.&nbsp; He would not let the Jews 
fight the Egyptians.&nbsp; He told them by the mouth of Moses, 
&ldquo;Stand you still, and the Lord shall fight for you,&rdquo; 
and he commanded Moses to stretch out his rod over the sea. 
(Exodus xiv.)&nbsp; The Egyptians were stronger than the 
Jews&mdash;they would have cut them to pieces if they had come to
a battle.&nbsp; For free civilised men like the Egyptians are 
always stronger than slaves, like the Jews; they respect 
themselves more, they hold together better, they have order and 
discipline, and obedience to their generals, which slaves have 
not.&nbsp; God intended to teach the Jews that also in His good 
time.&nbsp; But not yet.&nbsp; They were not fit yet to be made 
soldiers.&nbsp; They were not even <i>men</i> yet, but miserable 
slaves.&nbsp; A man is only a true man when he trusts in God, and
none but God&mdash;when he fears God and nothing <i>but</i> 
God.&nbsp; And that was the lesson which God had to teach 
them.&nbsp; That was the lesson which He taught them by bringing 
them up out of Egypt by signs and wonders, that <i>God was the 
Lord</i>, <i>God</i> was their deliverer, <i>God</i> was their 
King&mdash;that let <i>them</i> be as weak as they might, 
<i>He</i> was strong&mdash;that <!-- page 73--><a 
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>if they could
not fight the Egyptians God could overwhelm them&mdash;that if 
they could not cross the sea, God could open the sea to let them 
pass through.&nbsp; If they dreaded the waste howling wilderness 
of sand, with its pillars of cloud and fire, its stifling winds 
which burn the life out of man and beast, God could make the sand
storms and the fire pillars and the deadly east wind of the 
desert work for their deliverance.&nbsp; And so He taught them to
fear Himself, to trust in Him, to look up to Him as their 
deliverer whose strength was shown most gloriously when they were
weakest and most despairing.</p>
<p>This was the great lesson which God meant to teach the 
children of Israel, that the root and ground of all other 
lessons, is that this earth belongs to the Lord alone.&nbsp; That
had been what God had been teaching them already, by the plagues 
of Egypt.&nbsp; The Egyptians worshipped their great river Nile, 
and thought it was a god, and the Lord turned the Nile water into
blood, and showed that He could do what He liked with it.&nbsp; 
The Egyptians worshipped dumb beasts and insects, and fancied in 
their folly that they were gods.&nbsp; The Lord sent plagues of 
frogs and flies and locusts, and took them away again when He 
liked, to show them that the beasts and creeping things were His 
also.</p>
<p>The Egyptians worshipped false gods who as they fancied 
managed the seasons and the weather.&nbsp; God sent them thunder 
and hail when it pleased Him, and showed the Jews that <i>He</i>,
not these false gods of Egypt, ruled the heavens.&nbsp; The 
Egyptians and many other heathen nations of the earth used to 
offer their children to false gods.&nbsp; I do not mean by 
killing them in sacrifice, but by naming them after some idol, 
and then expecting that the idol would ever afterwards prosper 
and strengthen <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>them.&nbsp; Thus the kings were 
called after the sun.&nbsp; Pharaoh means the Sun-king; for they 
fancied that the sun was a god, and protected their kings one 
after the other.&nbsp; And God slew all the first-born of Egypt, 
even the first-born of King Pharaoh on his throne.&nbsp; The 
Sun-god could not help him.&nbsp; The idols of Egypt could not 
take care of their worshippers&mdash;only the children of the 
Jews escaped. (Exodus xii.)&nbsp; What a lesson for the 
Jews!&nbsp; And they needed it; for during the four hundred years
that they had been in Egypt they had almost forgotten the one 
true God, the God of their forefathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob;
at least they thought Him no better than the false gods of 
Egypt.&nbsp; After all these wondrous proofs of God&rsquo;s 
almighty power, and His jealousy for His own name, they fell away
to idols again and again.&nbsp; They worshipped a golden calf in 
Horeb (Exodus xxxii.); they turned aside to worship the idols of 
the nations whom they passed through on their way to 
Canaan.&nbsp; Idolatry had been rooted in their hearts, and it 
took many years of severe training and teaching on God&rsquo;s 
part to drive it out of them&mdash;to make them feel that the one
God, who made heaven and earth, had delivered them&mdash;that 
they belonged to Him, that they had a share in Him&mdash;to make 
them join with one heart and voice in the glorious song of 
Moses:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed 
gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the 
sea.&nbsp; The Lord is my strength and song and he is become my 
salvation: he is my God and I will prepare him an habitation; my 
father&rsquo;s God, and I will exalt him.&nbsp; The Lord is a man
of war: the Lord is his name.&nbsp; Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariots and 
his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains <!-- page
75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>also 
are drowned in the Red Sea.&nbsp; The depths have covered them: 
they sank into the bottom as a stone.&nbsp; Thy right hand, O 
Lord, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O Lord, hath 
dashed in pieces the enemy.&nbsp; And in the greatness of thine 
excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: 
thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as 
stubble.&nbsp; And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were
gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the 
depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.&nbsp; The enemy 
said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my
lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand 
shall deliver them.&nbsp; Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea 
covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.&nbsp; Who 
is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee, 
glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?&nbsp; 
Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed 
them.&nbsp; Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which 
thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto 
thy holy habitation.&nbsp; The people shall hear, and be afraid: 
sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.&nbsp; 
Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, 
trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of 
Canaan shall melt away.&nbsp; Fear and dread shall fall upon 
them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a 
stone; till thy people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass 
over, which thou hast purchased.&nbsp; Thou shalt bring them in 
and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the 
place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the 
Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.&nbsp; The 
Lord shall reign for ever and ever.&nbsp; <!-- page 76--><a 
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>For the horse
of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into 
the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon 
them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of
the sea.&rdquo; (Exodus xv. 1-19.)</p>
<p>This was God&rsquo;s first lesson to the Jews; the first step 
towards making them a free nation.&nbsp; For believe me, my 
friends, the only thought which can make men feel free and 
strong, the only thought which can keep them from being afraid of
each other, afraid of the seasons, and the elements, and the 
chances and changes of this mortal life, the only thought which 
can teach them that they are brothers, bound together to help and
love each other, in short the only thought which can make men 
citizens&mdash;is the thought that the one God is their Father, 
and that they are all His children&mdash;that they have one God, 
one religion, one baptism, one Lord and Saviour, who has 
delivered them, and will deliver them again and again from all 
their sins and miseries; one God and Father of all, who is in 
all, and for all, and over all, to whom they all owe equal duty, 
in whom they all have an equal share.</p>
<p>That lesson God began to teach the Jews by the Red Sea.&nbsp; 
That lesson God has taught our English forefathers again and 
again; and that lesson He will teach us, their children, as often
as we forget it, by signs and wonders, by chastisements and by 
mercies, till we all learn to trust in Him and Him only, and know
that there is none other name under heaven by which we can be 
saved from evil in this life or in the life to come, but the name
of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Angel of the Covenant, who 
led the Jews up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<h2><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
77</span>XI.&nbsp; DANGERS&mdash;AND THE LITANY.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then they cried unto the Lord in their 
trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.&nbsp; And
he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city 
of habitation.&nbsp; Oh that men would praise the Lord for his 
goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of 
men.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm</span> cvii. 6-8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This 107th Psalm is a noble psalm&mdash;a psalm which has 
given comfort to thousands in suffering and in danger, even in 
the sorrows which they have brought on themselves by their own 
folly.&nbsp; For it tells them of a Lord who hears them when they
cry to Him in their trouble, and who delivers them from their 
distress.</p>
<p>It was written on a special occasion, as all the most 
important words of the Bible are written&mdash;written seemingly,
after some band of Jews struggling across the desert, on their 
return from the captivity in Babylon, had been in great danger of
death.&nbsp; They went astray in the wilderness out of their way,
and found no city to rest in; hungry and thirsty their soul 
fainted in them, so they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, 
and He delivered them from their distress.&nbsp; He led them 
forth by the right way, that they might go to the city where they
dwelt.&nbsp; That was the plain fact, on which the psalmist built
up this noble psalm.</p>
<p>In the blazing sandy desert, without water, food, or shade, 
they had lost their path, and were at their wit&rsquo;s <!-- page
78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
78</span>end.&nbsp; And they cried unto the Lord their God for 
guidance, for they could not guide themselves.&nbsp; And the Lord
answered their prayer and guided them.&nbsp; We do not read that 
God worked a miracle for them, or sent an angel to lead 
them.&nbsp; Simply, somehow or other, they found their way after 
all, and got safe out of the desert; and they believed that it 
was God who enabled them to find their way, and praised the Lord 
for His goodness; and for His goodness not only to them, but to 
the children of men&mdash;to all men who had the sense to call on
Him in trouble, and to put themselves in their right place as 
men&mdash;God&rsquo;s children, calling for help to their Father 
in heaven.</p>
<p>Therefore the psalmist goes on to speak of the cases of 
God&rsquo;s goodness, which he seems to have seen, or at least 
heard of.&nbsp; Of wretched prisoners, bound fast in misery and 
iron, and that through their own fault and folly, who had cried 
unto the Lord in their trouble, and been delivered by Him from 
the darkness of the dungeon.&nbsp; Of foolish men who had ruined 
their health, or at least their prospects in life, by their own 
sin and folly, till their soul abhorred all manner of meat, and 
they were hard at death&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; But of them, too, he 
says, when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, He 
delivered them from their distress.&nbsp; He sent His 
word&mdash;what we now foolishly call the laws of Nature, but 
which the Psalmist knew to be the ever-working power and 
providence of God&mdash;and healed them, and they were saved from
their destruction.</p>
<p>Then he goes on to speak of the dangers of the sea which were 
especially strange and terrible to him&mdash;a Jew.&nbsp; For the
Jews were no sailors; and if they went to sea, would go as 
merchants, or supercargoes in ships <!-- page 79--><a 
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>manned by 
heathens; and the danger was really great.&nbsp; The ships were 
clumsy; navigation was ill-understood; the storms of the 
Mediterranean sea were then as now, sudden and furious; and when 
one came on, the heathen sailors would, I doubt not, be at their 
wit&rsquo;s end, their courage melting away because of the 
trouble, and call on all their gods and idols to help them; but 
the men of whom the Psalmist speaks, though they were no seamen, 
knew on whom to call.&nbsp; It was by the word of the Lord that 
the stormy wind arose which lifted up the billows.&nbsp; He could
quell the storm if He would, and when He would; and to Him they 
cried and not in vain.&nbsp; &ldquo;And He made the storm to 
cease so that the waves thereof were still.&nbsp; Then were they 
glad, because they were at rest, and so He brought them to the 
haven where they would be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friends, this was the simple faith of the old Jews.&nbsp; 
And this was the simple faith of our forefathers by land and 
sea.&nbsp; And this faith, as I believe, made England 
great.&nbsp; The faith that there was a living God, a living 
Lord, who would hear the cry of poor creatures in their trouble, 
even when they had brought their trouble on themselves.&nbsp; Our
forefathers were not mere landsmen like the Jews, but the finest 
seamen the world has ever seen.&nbsp; And yet they were not 
ashamed in storm and danger to cry like the Jews unto the Lord, 
that He might make the storm to cease, and bring them to the 
haven where they would be.&nbsp; Yes! faith in God did not make 
them the less brave, skilful, cautious, scientific; and it need 
not make us so.&nbsp; Skill and science need not take away our 
faith in God.&nbsp; I trust it will not take it away, and I 
believe it will not take it away, as long as <!-- page 80--><a 
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>we can hear 
what I once heard, on board of one of the finest men of war <a 
name="citation80a"></a><a href="#footnote80a" 
class="citation">[80a]</a> in the British Navy&mdash;the ship in 
which and from which, all British sailors may learn their 
duty&mdash;when I saw some six or eight hundred men mustered on 
the deck for daily morning prayer, and heard the noble old 
prayer, which our forefathers have handed down to us, to be said 
every day in Her Majesty&rsquo;s navy: <a 
name="citation80b"></a><a href="#footnote80b" 
class="citation">[80b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;O eternal God who alone spreadest out the heavens, and 
rulest the raging of the sea; who hast compassed the waters with 
bounds, until day and night come to an end; be pleased to receive
into Thy Almighty and most gracious protection, the persons of us
Thy servants, and the fleet in which we serve.&nbsp; Preserve us 
from the dangers of the sea, and from the violence of the enemy, 
that we may be a safeguard unto our most gracious Sovereign Lady 
Queen Victoria and her dominions, and a security for such as pass
on the seas upon their lawful occasions; that the inhabitants of 
our island may in peace and quietness serve Thee our God, and 
that we may return in safety to enjoy the blessings of the land, 
with the fruits of our labours, and with a thankful remembrance 
of Thy mercies, to praise and glorify Thy holy name; through 
Jesus Christ our Lord.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as I stood upon that deck, and heard that solemn appeal 
to God, before each man went about his appointed duty for the 
day, said I to myself, &ldquo;The ancient spirit is not 
dead.&nbsp; It may be that it is sleeping in these prosperous 
times.&nbsp; But it is not dead, as long as this nation by those 
prayers confesses that we ought at least to believe in a God who 
hears our prayers, by <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>land and sea.&nbsp; Those grand words
were perhaps nothing but a form to most of the men who heard 
them.&nbsp; But they were a form which bore witness to a truth 
which was true, even if they forgot it&mdash;a truth which they 
might need some day, and feel the need of, and cling to, as the 
sailors of old time clung to it.&nbsp; Those words would surely 
sink into the men&rsquo;s ears, and some day, it might be, bear 
fruit in their hearts.&nbsp; In storm, in wreck, in battle, and 
in the hour of death, and in the day of judgment, these words 
would surely rise in many a brave fellow&rsquo;s memory, and help
him to do his duty like a man, because there was a living Lord 
and God above him who knew his weakness and would hear his 
prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And we, my friends, here safe on land, we have a national 
prayer, or rather a series of prayers, to Christ as God, which 
ought to remind us of that noble truth which the 107th Psalm is 
meant to teach.&nbsp; You hear it all of you every Sunday 
morning.&nbsp; I mean the Litany.&nbsp; That noble composition, 
which seems to me more wise as a work of theology, more beautiful
as a work of art, the oftener I use it&mdash;That Litany, I say, 
is modelled on the 107th Psalm; and it expresses the very heart 
and spirit of our forefathers three hundred years ago.&nbsp; It 
bids us pray to be delivered from every conceivable harm, to 
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&nbsp; And then it prays for every 
conceivable blessing, not only for each of us separately, but for
this whole nation of England, Great Britain, and Ireland, and for
all the nations on earth, and for the heathen and the savage.</p>
<p>Of course, just because it is a National prayer, and meant for
all Englishmen alike, all of it does not suit each and every one 
of us at the same time.&nbsp; Each heart <!-- page 82--><a 
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>knows its own
bitterness.&nbsp; Each soul has its own special mercy to 
ask.&nbsp; But there is a word in the Litany here, and another 
there, which will fit each of us in turn, if we will but follow 
it.&nbsp; One may have to pray to be delivered from pride, 
vain-glory, and hypocrisy&mdash;another to be delivered from foul
living and deadly sin&mdash;another to be delivered, or to have 
those whom he loves delivered, from battle, murder, and sudden 
death.&nbsp; Another to be delivered from the dangers of 
affliction and tribulation; another from the far worse danger of 
wrath; but all have to pray to be delivered from something.&nbsp;
And all have to pray to the same deliverer&mdash;Christ, who was 
born a Man, died a man, and rose again a man, that He might know 
what was in man, and be able to succour those who are tempted, 
seeing that He was tempted in all things like as we are, yet 
without sin.</p>
<p>But there is a part&mdash;the latter part&mdash;of that Litany
which, I think, many do not understand or feel.&nbsp; Perhaps 
they have reason to thank God that they do not understand or feel
it; yet, the day may come&mdash;a day of sadness, fear, 
perplexity, sorrow, when they will understand it, and thank God 
that their forefathers placed it in the prayer-book, for them to 
fall back upon, as comfort and hope in the day of trouble; 
putting words into their mouths and thoughts into their hearts, 
which they, perhaps, never would have found out for 
themselves.</p>
<p>I mean that latter part of the Litany which talks of the evils
which the craft and subtilty of the devil or men work against us,
that they may be brought to nought, and by the providence of 
God&rsquo;s goodness be dispersed, that we may be hurt by no 
persecutions&mdash;which calls on Christ to arise and deliver us,
for His name&rsquo;s <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>sake and His honour, which pleads 
before God the noble works which He did in the days of our 
forefathers; and which continues with short prayers, almost 
cries, which have something in them of terror, almost of 
agony.&nbsp; What have such words to do with us?&nbsp; Why are 
they put into the mouths of us English, safe, comfortable, 
prosperous, above almost all the nations upon earth?</p>
<p>Ah! my friends, those prayers, when they were first put into 
our prayer-book, were spoken for the hearts of Englishmen.&nbsp; 
They were not prayers for one afflicted person here, and another 
there,&mdash;they, too, were National prayers.&nbsp; They were 
the cries of the English nation in agony&mdash;in the time when, 
three hundred years ago, the mightiest nations and powers of 
Europe, temporal and spiritual, were set against this little isle
of England, and we expected not merely to be invaded and 
conquered, but destroyed utterly and horribly with sword and 
fire, by the fleets and armies of the King of Spain.&nbsp; In 
that great danger and war our forefathers cried to God; and they 
cried all the more earnestly, because they felt that their hands 
were not clean; that they had plenty and too many sins to be 
&ldquo;mercifully forgiven,&rdquo; and that at best they could 
but ask God &ldquo;mercifully to look upon their 
infirmities,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;for the glory of His name, turn 
from them those evils which they most righteously had 
deserved.&rdquo;&nbsp; But nevertheless they cried unto God in 
their great agony, because they had the spirit of the old 
Psalmist, who said, &ldquo;They cried unto the Lord in their 
trouble, and He delivered them out of their distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what answer God made to their prayers all the world knows,
or should know.&nbsp; For if He had not answered their prayer, we
should not be here this day, a great, and <!-- page 84--><a 
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>strong, and 
prosperous nation, with a pure Church and a free Gospel, and the 
Holy Bible if he wills, in the hands of the poorest child.&nbsp; 
Unless prayer be a dream, and there be no God in heaven worth 
calling a God&mdash;then did God answer the prayers of our 
forefathers three hundred years ago, when they cried unto Him as 
one nation in their utter need.</p>
<p>But some will say&mdash;this may be all very true and very 
fine, but we are in no such utter need now.&nbsp; Why should we 
use those prayers?</p>
<p>My dear friends, let me say, if you are not now in utter need,
in terror, anxiety, danger, if you have no need to cry to Christ,
&ldquo;Graciously look upon our afflictions; pitifully behold the
sorrows of our hearts,&rdquo; how do you know that there is not 
some one in any and every congregation who is?&nbsp; And you and 
I, if we have said the Litany in spirit and in truth, have been 
praying for them.&nbsp; The Litany bids us speak as members of a 
Church, as citizens of a nation, bound together by the ties of 
blood and of laws, as well as self-interest.&nbsp; The Litany 
bids us say, not selfishly and apart, Graciously look on 
<i>my</i> afflictions, but on <i>our</i> afflictions&mdash;the 
afflictions of every English man, and woman, and child, who is in
trouble, or ever will be in trouble <i>hereafter</i>.&nbsp; Oh, 
remember this last word.&nbsp; Generations long since dead and 
buried have prayed for you, and God has heard their prayers; and 
now you have been praying for your children, and your 
children&rsquo;s children, and generations yet unborn, that, if 
ever a dark day should come over England, a time of want and 
danger and perplexity and misery, God would deliver them in their
turn out of their distress.&nbsp; And more; you have been 
teaching your children, that they may teach their children in 
<!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
85</span>turn, and pray and cry to God in their trouble; and thus
this grand old Litany is to us, and to those we shall leave 
behind us a precious National heir-loom, teaching us and them the
lesson of the 107th Psalm&mdash;that there is a Lord in heaven 
who hears the prayers of men, the sinful as well as the 
sorrowful, that when they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, He 
delivers them out of their distress, and that men should 
therefore praise the Lord for His goodness, and declare the 
wonders which He doeth for the children of men.</p>

86</span>XII.&nbsp; WILD TIMES, OR DAVID&rsquo;S FAITH IN A 
LIVING GOD.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;David therefore departed thence, and 
escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his 
father&rsquo;s house heard it, they went down thither to 
him.&nbsp; And every one that was in distress, and every one that
was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered 
themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there
were with him about four hundred men.&rdquo;&mdash;1 <span 
class="smcap">Sam.</span> xxii. 1, 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In every country, at some time or other, there have been evil 
days&mdash;days of violence, tyranny, misrule, war, invasion, 
when men are too apt, for want of settled law, to take the law 
into their own hands; and the land is full of robbers, outlaws, 
bands of partizans and irregular soldiers&mdash;wild times, in 
which wild things are done.</p>
<p>Of such times we here in England have had no experience, and 
we forget how common they are; we forget that many great nations 
have been in this state again and again.&nbsp; We forget that 
almost all Europe was in that wild and lawless state in our 
fathers&rsquo; times, and therefore we forget that the Bible, 
which tells man his whole duty, must needs tell men about such 
times as those, and how a man may do his duty, and save his soul 
therein.&nbsp; For the Bible is every man&rsquo;s book, and has 
its lesson for every man.&nbsp; It is meant not merely for 
comfortable English folk, who sit at home at ease, under just 
laws and a good government.&nbsp; It is meant just as much for 
the opprest, for the persecuted, for the <!-- page 87--><a 
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>man who is 
fighting for his country, for the man who has been found fighting
in vain, and is simply waiting for God&rsquo;s help, and crying, 
&ldquo;Lord, how long? how long ere Thou avenge the blood that is
shed?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is meant as much for such as for you and 
me; that every man, in whatever fearful times he may live, and 
whatever fearful trials he may go through, and whatever fearful 
things he may be tempted to do, and, indeed, may have to do, in 
self-defence, may still be able to go to the Bible, there to find
light for his feet, and a lantern for his path, and so that he 
may steer through the worst of times by Faith in the Living 
God.</p>
<p>Again, such lawless times are certain to raise up bold and 
adventurous men, more or less like David.&nbsp; Men of 
blood&mdash;who are yet not altogether bad men&mdash;who are 
forced to take the law into their own hands, to try and keep 
their countrymen together, to put down tyrants and robbers, and 
to drive out invaders.&nbsp; And men, too, suffering from deep 
and cruel wrongs, who are forced for their lives&rsquo; sake, and
their honour&rsquo;s sake, to escape&mdash;to flee to the 
mountains and the forests, and to foreign lands, and there live 
as they can till times shall be better.&nbsp; There have been 
such men in all wild times&mdash;outlaws, chiefs of armed bands, 
like our Robin Hood, whose name was honoured in England for 
hundreds of years as the protector of the poor and the opprest, 
and the punisher of the Norman tyrants: a man made up of much 
good and much evil, whom we must not judge, but when we think of 
him, only thank God that we do not live in such times now, when 
no man&rsquo;s life or property, or the honour of his family was 
safe.</p>
<p>Such men, too, in our fathers&rsquo; days, were the Tyrolese 
heroes, Hofer and the Good Monk who left, the one his <!-- page 
88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>farm 
and the other his cloister, to lead their countrymen against the 
invading French; men of blood, who were none the less men of 
God.&nbsp; And such is, in our own days, that famous Garibaldi, 
whose portrait hangs in many an English cottage, for a proof that
though we, thank God, do not need such men in peaceful England, 
our hearts bid us to love and honour them wherever they be.&nbsp;
There have been such men in all bad times, and there will be till
the world&rsquo;s end, and they will do great deeds, and their 
names will be famous, and often honoured and adored by men.</p>
<p>Now, what does the Bible say of such men?&nbsp; Does it give 
any rule by which we may judge them? any rule which they ought to
obey?&nbsp; Can God&rsquo;s blessing be on them?&nbsp; Can they 
obey God in that wild and dark and dangerous station to which He 
seems to have called them&mdash;to which God certainly called 
Hofer and the Good Monk?</p>
<p>I think if the Bible did not answer that question it would not
be a complete book&mdash;if it spoke only of peaceful folk, and 
peaceful times; when, alas! from the beginning of the world, the 
earth has been but too full of violence and misrule, war and 
desolation.&nbsp; But the Bible <i>does</i> answer that 
question.&nbsp; A large portion of one whole book is actually 
taken up with the history of a young outlaw&mdash;of David, the 
shepherd boy, who rises through strange temptations and dangers 
to be a great king, the first man who, since Moses, formed the 
Jews into one strong united nation.&nbsp; It does not hide his 
faults, even his fearful sins, but it shows us that he <i>had</i>
a right road to follow, though he often turned aside from 
it.&nbsp; It shows us that he could be a good man if he chose, 
though he was an outlaw at the head of a band of <!-- page 
89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
89</span>ruffians; and it shows us the secret of his power and of
his success&mdash;<i>Faith in the Living God</i>.</p>
<p>Therefore it is that after the Bible has shown us (in the Book
of Ruth) worthy Boaz standing among his reapers in the barley 
field, it goes on to show us Boaz&rsquo;s great-grandson, David, 
a worthy man likewise, but of a very different life, marked out 
by God from his youth for strange and desperate deeds; killing, 
as a mere boy, a lion and a bear, overthrowing the Philistine 
giant with a sling and a stone, captain of a band of outlaws in 
the wilderness, fighting battles upon battles; and at last a 
king, storming the mountain fortress of Jerusalem, and setting up
upon Mount Zion, which shall never be removed, the Throne of 
David.&nbsp; A strange man, and born into a strange time.&nbsp; 
You all know the first part of David&rsquo;s history&mdash;how 
Samuel secretly anoints David king over Israel, and how the 
Spirit of the Lord comes from that day forward upon the young lad
(1 Samuel xvi. 12).&nbsp; How king Saul meanwhile fell into dark 
and bad humours.&nbsp; How the Spirit of the Lord&mdash;of 
goodness and peace of mind&mdash;goes from him, and an evil 
spirit from the Lord troubles him.&nbsp; Then how young David is 
sent for to play to him on his harp (1 Samuel xvi.), and soothe 
his distempered mind.&nbsp; Already we hear of David as a 
remarkable person; we hear of his extraordinary beauty, his skill
in music; we hear, too, how he is already a man of war, and a 
mighty valiant man, and prudent in matters, and the Lord is with 
him.</p>
<p>Then follows the famous story of his killing Goliath the 
Philistine (1 Samuel xvii.).&nbsp; Poor, distempered Saul, it 
seems, had forgotten him, though David had cured his melancholy 
with his harp-playing, and had actually been for a while his 
armour-bearer, for when he <!-- page 90--><a 
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>comes back 
with the giant&rsquo;s head, Saul has to ask Abner who he is; but
after that he will let him go no more home to his father.</p>
<p>Then follows the beautiful story of Jonathan, Saul&rsquo;s 
gallant son (1 Samuel xviii.), and his love for David.&nbsp; Then
of Saul&rsquo;s envy of David, and how, in a sudden fit of 
hatred, he casts his javelin at him.&nbsp; Then how he grows 
afraid of him, and makes him captain of a thousand men, and gives
him his daughter, on condition of David&rsquo;s killing him two 
hundred Philistines.&nbsp; And how he goes on, capriciously, 
honouring David one day and trying to kill him the next.&nbsp; 
While David rises always, and all Israel and Judah love him, and 
he behaves himself more wisely than all the servants of 
Saul.&nbsp; At last comes the open rupture.&nbsp; Saul, after 
trying to murder David, sends assassins to his house, and David 
flees for his life once and for all.&nbsp; He has served his 
master Saul loyally and faithfully.&nbsp; There is no word of his
having opposed Saul, set himself up against him, boasted of 
himself, or in any way brought his anger down upon him.&nbsp; 
Saul is his king, and David has been loyal and true to him.&nbsp;
But Saul&rsquo;s envy has grown to hatred, and that to 
murder.&nbsp; He murders the priests, with all their wives and 
children, for having given bread and shelter to David.&nbsp; And 
now David must flee into the wilderness and set up for himself, 
and he flees to the cave of Adullam (1 Samuel xxii.); and there 
you see the Bible does not try to hide what David&rsquo;s 
position was, and what sort of men he had about him&mdash;his 
brethren and his father&rsquo;s house, who were afraid that Saul 
would kill them instead of him, after the barbarous Eastern 
fashion, and among them the three sons of Zeruiah, his sister; 
and everyone <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>who was discontented, and everyone 
who was in debt, all the most desperate and needy&mdash;one can 
conceive what sort of men they must have been.&nbsp; The Bible 
tells us afterwards of the wicked men and men of Belial who were 
among them&mdash;wild men, with weapons in their hands, and 
nothing to prevent their becoming a band of brutal robbers, if 
they had not had over them a man in whom, in spite of all his 
faults, was the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>We must remember, meanwhile, that David had his 
temptations.&nbsp; He had been grievously wronged.&nbsp; Saul had
returned him evil for good.&nbsp; All David&rsquo;s services and 
loyalty to Saul had been repaid with ingratitude and accusations 
of conspiracy against him.&nbsp; What terrible struggles of rage 
and indignation must have passed through David&rsquo;s 
heart!&nbsp; What a longing to revenge himself!&nbsp; He knew, 
too, for Samuel the prophet had told him, that he should be king 
one day.&nbsp; What a temptation, then, to make himself king at 
once!&nbsp; It was no secret either.&nbsp; The people knew of 
it.&nbsp; Jonathan, Saul&rsquo;s son, knew of it, and, in his 
noble, self-sacrificing way, makes no secret of it (1 Samuel 
xx.).&nbsp; What a temptation to follow the fashion which is too 
common in the East to this day, and strike down his tyrant at one
blow, as many a man has done since, and to proclaim himself king 
of the Jews.&nbsp; Yes, David had heavy 
temptations&mdash;temptations which he could only conquer by 
faith in the Living God.&nbsp; And, because he masters himself, 
and remains patient and loyal to his king under every insult and 
wrong, he is able to master that wild and desperate band of men, 
and set them an example of patience and chivalry, loyalty and 
justice; to train them to be, not a terror and a scourge to the 
yeomen and peasants round, but a protection and a guard against 
<!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
92</span>the Philistines and Amalekites, and, in due time, his 
trusty bodyguard of warriors&mdash;men who have grown grey beside
him through a hundred battles, who are to be the foundation of 
his national army, and help him to make the Jews one strong and 
united prosperous kingdom.</p>
<p>All this the shepherd lad has to do, and he does it, by faith 
in the Living God, and so makes himself for all ages to come the 
pattern of perfect loyalty.&nbsp; And now, let us take home this 
one lesson&mdash;That the secret of David&rsquo;s success is not 
his beauty, his courage, his eloquence, his genius; other men 
have had gifts from God as great as David&rsquo;s, and have 
misused them to their own ruin, and to the misery of their 
fellow-men.&nbsp; No; the secret of David&rsquo;s success is his 
faith in the Living God; and that will be the secret of our 
success.&nbsp; <i>Without</i> faith in God, the most splendid 
talents may lead a man to be a curse to himself and to his 
neighbours.&nbsp; <i>With</i> faith in God, a very common-place 
person, without any special cleverness, may do great things, and 
make himself useful and honoured in his generation.</p>

93</span>XIII.&nbsp; DAVID AND NABAL, OR SELF-CONTROL.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the 
Lord God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me: And 
blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me 
this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with
mine own hand.&rdquo;&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Samuel</span> 
xxv. 32, 33.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story of David and Nabal needs no explanation.&nbsp; It 
tells us of part of David&rsquo;s education&mdash;of a great 
lesson which he learnt&mdash;of a great lesson which we may 
learn.&nbsp; It is told with a dignity and a simplicity, with a 
grace and liveliness which makes itself understood at once, and 
carries its own lesson to any one who has a human heart in 
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in 
Carmel&rdquo;&mdash;the park grass upland with timber 
trees&mdash;not the northern Carmel where Elijah slew the 
prophets of Baal, but the southern one on the edge of the 
desert.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the man was very great, and he had three
thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his 
sheep in Carmel.&nbsp; Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the
name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good 
understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was 
churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of 
Caleb.&rdquo;&nbsp; Caleb was Joshua&rsquo;s friend, who had 
conquered all that land in Joshua&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; Nabal, 
therefore, <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>had all the pride of a man of most 
ancient and noble family&mdash;and no shame to him if he had had 
a noble, courteous, and generous heart therewith, instead of 
being, as he was, a stupid and brutal person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear 
his sheep.&nbsp; And David sent out ten young men, and David said
unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and 
greet him in my name: And thus shall ye say unto him that liveth 
in prosperity, Peace be to thee, and peace be to thine house, and
peace be to all that thou hast.&nbsp; And now I have heard that 
thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt
them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the 
while they were in Carmel.&nbsp; Ask the young men, and they will
show thee.&nbsp; Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine
eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever 
cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and unto thy son 
David.&nbsp; And when David&rsquo;s young men came, they spake to
Nabal, according to all thee words of David, and 
ceased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nabal refuses; and in a way that shows, as his wife says of 
him, how well his name fits him&mdash;a fool is his name, and 
folly is with him.&nbsp; Insolently and brutally he refuses, as 
fools are wont to do.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Nabal answered 
David&rsquo;s servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the 
son of Jesse? there be many servants now-a-days that break away 
every man from his master.&nbsp; Shall I then take my bread, and 
my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and 
give it unto men whom I know not whence they be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As slaves break away from their master.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
This was an intolerable insult.&nbsp; To taunt a free-born man, 
as <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
95</span>David was, with having been a slave and a runaway.&nbsp;
It is hard to conceive how Nabal dared to say such a thing of a 
fierce chieftain like David, with six hundred armed men at his 
back; but there is no saying what a fool will not do when the 
spirit of the Lord is gone from him, and his own fancy and 
passions lead him captive.</p>
<p>So David&rsquo;s young men came and told David.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;And David said to his men, Gird every man on his 
sword.&nbsp; And they girded on every man his sword; and David 
also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about 
four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is a grand passage&mdash;grand, because it is true to 
human nature, true to the determined, prompt, kingly character of
David.&nbsp; He does not complain, bluster, curse over the insult
as a weak man might have done.&nbsp; He has been deeply hurt, and
he is too high-minded to talk about it.&nbsp; He will do, and not
talk.&nbsp; A dark purpose settles itself instantly in his 
mind.&nbsp; Perhaps he is ashamed of it, and dare not speak of 
it, even to himself.&nbsp; But what it was he confessed 
afterwards to Abigail, that he purposed utterly to kill Nabal and
all his people.&nbsp; David was wrong of course.&nbsp; But the 
Bible makes no secret of the wrong-doings of its heroes.&nbsp; It
does not tell us that they were infallible and perfect.&nbsp; It 
tells us that they were men of like passions with ourselves, in 
order that by seeing how they conquered their passions we may 
conquer ours.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nabal&rsquo;s young men, his servants and slaves, 
see the danger, and go to Abigail.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of the young 
men told Abigail, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of 
the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.&nbsp;
But the men were very good <!-- page 96--><a 
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>unto us, and 
we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were
conversant with them, when we were in the fields: They were a 
wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with 
them keeping the sheep.&nbsp; Now therefore know and consider 
what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and
against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a
man cannot speak to him.&nbsp; Then Abigail made haste, and took 
two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready
dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred 
clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them
on asses.&nbsp; And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; 
behold, I come after you.&nbsp; But she told not her husband 
Nabal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then follows the beautiful scene which has been the 
subject of many a noble picture.&nbsp; The fair lady kneeling 
before the terrible outlaw in the mountain woods, as she came 
down by the covert of the hill, and softening his fierce heart 
with her beauty and her eloquence and her prayers, and bringing 
him back to his true self&mdash;to forgiveness, generosity, and 
righteousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off
the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to 
the ground, and fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, let
this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in 
thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.&nbsp; Let 
not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: 
for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is 
with him; but I, thine handmaid, saw not the young men of my 
lord, whom thou didst send.&nbsp; Now therefore, my lord, as the 
Lord liveth, and as thy soul <!-- page 97--><a 
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>liveth, 
seeing the Lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, 
and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine 
enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal. . . . I
pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the Lord 
will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord 
fighteth the battles of the Lord, and evil hath not been found in
thee all thy days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she conquers.&nbsp; The dark shadow passes off 
David&rsquo;s soul, and he is again the true, chivalrous, 
God-fearing David, who has never drawn sword yet in his own 
private quarrel, but has committed his cause to God who judgeth 
righteously, and will, if a man abide patiently in Him, make his 
righteousness as clear as the light, and his just-dealing as the 
noonday.&nbsp; Frankly he confesses his fault.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou which has kept 
me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself 
with mine own hand.&nbsp; For in very deed, as the Lord God of 
Israel liveth, which has kept me back from hurting thee, except 
thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not a man
been left unto Nabal by the morning light.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then 
follows the end.&nbsp; Abigail goes back to Nabal.&nbsp; Then the
bully shows himself a coward.&nbsp; The very thought of the 
danger which he has escaped is too much for him.&nbsp; His heart 
died within him.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Abigail came to Nabal; and 
behold, he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king; 
and Nabal&rsquo;s heart was merry within him, for he was very 
drunken: wherefore she told him nothing less or more until the 
morning light.&nbsp; But it came to pass in the morning, when the
wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these 
things, that his heart died within him, and <!-- page 98--><a 
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>he became as 
a stone.&nbsp; And it came to pass, about ten days after, that 
the Lord smote Nabal, that he died.&rdquo;&nbsp; One can imagine 
the picture for oneself.&nbsp; The rich churl sitting there in 
the midst of all his slaves and his wealth as one thunderstruck, 
helpless and speechless, till one of those mysterious attacks, 
which we still rightly call a stroke, and a visitation of God, 
ends him miserably.&nbsp; And when he is dead, Abigail becomes 
the wife of David, and shares his fortunes and his dangers in the
wilderness.</p>
<p>Now, what may we learn from this story?&nbsp; Surely what 
David learnt&mdash;the unlawfulness of revenge.&nbsp; David was 
to be trained to be a perfect king by learning self-control, and 
therefore he has to learn that he must not punish in his own 
quarrel.&nbsp; If he must not lift up his hand against Saul, on 
the ground of loyalty, neither must he lift up his hand against 
Nabal, on the deeper ground of justice and humanity.</p>
<p>But from whom did David learn this?&nbsp; From himself.&nbsp; 
From his own heart and conscience, enlightened by the Spirit of 
God.&nbsp; Abigail gave him no commandment from God, in the 
common sense of the word.&nbsp; She only put David in mind of 
what he knew already.&nbsp; She appeals to his known nobleness of
mind, and takes for granted that he will hear reason&mdash;takes 
for granted that he will do right&mdash;and so brought him to 
himself again.&nbsp; The Lord was withholding him, she says, from
coming to shed blood, and avenging himself with his own 
hand.&nbsp; But that would have been of no avail had there not 
been something in David&rsquo;s own heart which answered to her 
words.&nbsp; For the Spirit of God had not left David; and it was
the Spirit of God which gave him nobleness of heart&mdash;the 
Spirit of God which made him answer, <!-- page 99--><a 
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
99</span>&ldquo;Blessed be the Lord God of Israel who sent thee 
this day to meet me; and blessed be thy advice, and blessed be 
thou which hast kept me this day from shedding of 
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Abigail did not pretend to bring a message from God, 
David felt that she had brought one.&nbsp; And she was in his 
eyes not merely a suppliant pleading for mercy, but a prophetess 
declaring to him a divine law which he dare not resist.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It has been said by them of old time,&rdquo; our blessed 
Lord tells us, &ldquo;an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;
thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
This is the first natural law which a savage lays down for 
himself.&nbsp; There is a rude sense of justice in it, mixed up 
with the same brute instinct of revenge which makes the wild 
beast turn in rage upon the hunter who wounds him.&nbsp; But our 
Lord Jesus Christ brings in a higher and more spiritual 
law.&nbsp; Punishment is to be left to the magistrate, who 
punishes in God&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; And where the law cannot 
touch the wrongdoer, God, who is the author of law, can and will 
punish.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the 
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes! if punishment must be, then let God 
punish.&nbsp; Let man forgive.&nbsp; I say unto you, said our 
Lord, &ldquo;Love your enemies.&nbsp; Do good to them that hate 
you&mdash;bless them that curse you&mdash;pray for them that 
despitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be the 
children of your Father which is in heaven, for He maketh His sun
to shine upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just
and the unjust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a hard lesson.&nbsp; But we must learn it.&nbsp; And we 
shall learn it, just as far as we are guided by the Spirit of 
God, who forms in us the likeness of Christ.&nbsp; And <!-- page 
100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
100</span>men are learning it more and more in Christian 
lands.&nbsp; Wherever Christ&rsquo;s gospel is truly and 
faithfully preached, the fashion, of revenge is dying out.&nbsp; 
There are countries still in Christendom in which men think 
nothing every day of stabbing and shooting the man who has 
injured them; and far, very far, from Christ and His Spirit must 
they be still.&nbsp; But we may have hope for them; for if we 
look at home, it was not so very many years ago that any 
Englishman, who considered himself a gentleman, was bound by 
public opinion to fight a duel for any slight insult.&nbsp; It 
was not so many years ago that among labouring men brutal 
quarrels and open fights were common, and almost daily 
occurrences.&nbsp; But now men are learning more and more to 
control their tempers and their tongues, and find it more and 
more easy, and more pleasant and more profitable, as our Lord 
forewarned them when He said, &ldquo;Take my yoke upon you and 
learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find 
rest unto your souls, for my yoke is easy, and my burden is 
light.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Christ&rsquo;s easy yoke is the yoke of 
self-control, by which we bridle the passions which torment 
us.&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s light burden is the burden and 
obligation laid on every one of us, to forgive others, even as 
God for Christ&rsquo;s sake has forgiven us.&nbsp; And the rest 
which shall come to our souls is the rest which David found, when
he listened to the voice of God speaking by the lips of Abigail; 
the true and divine rest of heart and peace of mind&mdash;rest 
and peace from the inward storm of fretfulness, suspicion, 
jealousy, pride, wrath, revenge, which blackens the light of 
heaven to a man, and turns to gall and wormwood every blessing 
which God sends.</p>
<p>Ah! my friends, if ever that angry storm rises in our <!-- 
page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
101</span>hearts, if ever we be tempted to avenge ourselves, and 
cast off the likeness of God for that of the savage, and return 
evil for evil,&mdash;may God send to us in that day some angel of
His own, as He sent Abigail to David&mdash;an angel, though 
clothed in human flesh and blood, with a message of peace and 
wisdom.&nbsp; And if any such should speak to us words of peace 
and wisdom, soothing us and rebuking us at once, and appealing to
those feelings in us which are really the most noble, just 
because they are the most gentle, then let us not turn away in 
pride, and wrap ourselves up in our own anger, but let us receive
these words as the message of God&mdash;whether they come from 
the lips of a woman, or of a servant, or even of a little child, 
for if we resist them we surely resist God&mdash;who has also 
given to us His Holy Spirit for that very purpose, that we may 
hear His message when He speaks.&nbsp; It was the Spirit of God 
in David which made him feel that Abigail&rsquo;s message was 
divine.&nbsp; The Spirit of God, hidden for a while behind his 
dark passions, like the sun by clouds, shone out clear again, and
filled all his soul with light, showing him his duty, and giving 
back peace and brightness to his mind.</p>
<p>God grant that whenever we are tried like David we may find 
that that Holy Spirit has not left us, but that even if a first 
storm of anger shall burst, it shall pass over quickly, and the 
day star arise in our hearts, and the Lord lift up the light of 
His countenance upon us, and give us peace.</p>
<h2><!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>XIV.&nbsp; DAVID&rsquo;S LOYALTY; 
OR, TEMPTATION RESISTED.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So David and Abishai came to the people by 
night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his 
spear stuck in the ground at his bolster; but Abner and the 
people lay round about him.&nbsp; Then said Abishai to David, God
hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now 
therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to 
the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second 
time.&nbsp; And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who 
can stretch forth his hand against the Lord&rsquo;s anointed, and
be guiltless?&nbsp; David said furthermore, As the Lord liveth, 
the Lord shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he 
shall descend into battle, and perish.&nbsp; The Lord forbid that
I should stretch forth mine hand against the Lord&rsquo;s 
anointed; but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at 
his bolster, and the cruise of water, and let us 
go.&rdquo;&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Sam.</span> xxvi. 
7-11.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David stands for all times as the pattern of true 
loyalty&mdash;loyalty under the most extreme temptation.&nbsp; 
Knowing that he is to be king himself hereafter, he yet remains 
loyal to his king though unjustly persecuted to the death.&nbsp; 
Loyal he is to the end, because he has <i>faith</i> and 
<i>obedience</i>.&nbsp; Faith tells him that if king he is to be,
king he will be, in God&rsquo;s good time.&nbsp; If God had 
promised, God will perform.&nbsp; He must not make himself 
king.&nbsp; He must not take the matter into his own hand.&nbsp; 
Obedience tells him that Saul is still his master, and he is 
bound to him.&nbsp; If Saul be a bad master, that does not give 
him leave to be a bad servant.&nbsp; The sacred bond still 
remains, and he must not break it.&nbsp; But Saul <!-- page 
103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>is
more.&nbsp; He is king&mdash;the Lord&rsquo;s anointed, the 
general of the armies of the living God.&nbsp; His office is 
sacred; his person is sacred.&nbsp; He is a public personage, and
David must not lift up his hand against him in a private 
quarrel.</p>
<p>Twice David&rsquo;s faith and obedience are tried 
fearfully.&nbsp; Twice Saul is in his power.&nbsp; Twice the 
temptation to murder him comes before him.&nbsp; The first time 
David and his men are in one of the great branching caves of 
Engaddi, the desolate limestone cliffs, two thousand feet high, 
which overhang the Dead Sea&mdash;and Saul is hunting him, as he 
says, as a partridge on the mountains.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it came 
to pass when Saul had returned from following the Philistines, 
that it was told him saying, Behold David is in the cave of 
Engedi.&nbsp; And Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all 
Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the 
wild goats.&nbsp; And he came to the sheepcotes, and by the way 
there was a cave; and Saul went in, and David and his men 
remained in the sides of the cave.&nbsp; And the men of David 
said unto him, Behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee, 
Behold I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand, and thou mayest 
do to him as seemeth good unto thee.&nbsp; Then David arose, and 
cut off the skirt of Saul&rsquo;s robe privily.&nbsp; And it came
to pass afterwards, that David&rsquo;s heart smote him, because 
he had cut off Saul&rsquo;s skirt.&nbsp; And he said unto his 
men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, 
the Lord&rsquo;s anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against 
him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.&nbsp; So David stayed
his servants.&rdquo;&nbsp; And afterwards Saul rose up, not 
knowing what had happened, and David followed him.&nbsp; And when
Saul looked back, David stooped down with his face to the earth 
and <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>bowed himself before Saul, and spoke
many noble words to his king (1 Sam. xxiv. 1-8).</p>
<p><i>And David&rsquo;s nobleness has its reward</i>.&nbsp; It 
brings out nobleness in return to Saul himself.&nbsp; It melts 
his heart for a time.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it came to pass that when 
David had made an end of speaking, that Saul said, Is this thy 
voice, my son David?&nbsp; And Saul lifted up his voice, and 
wept.&nbsp; And he said to David, &lsquo;Thou art more righteous 
than I&mdash;for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have 
rewarded thee evil.&nbsp; And thou hast shewed me this day how 
thou hast dealt with me; for as much as when the Lord delivered 
me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.&nbsp; For if a man find
his enemy, will he let him go well away?&nbsp; Wherefore the Lord
reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.&nbsp; 
And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and 
that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine 
hand.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it will be with you, my friends.&nbsp; &ldquo;If thine 
enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink, for so thou
shalt heap coals of fire on his head.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thou shalt 
melt the hardness of his heart.&nbsp; Thou shalt warm the 
coldness of his heart.&nbsp; Nobleness in thee shall bring out in
answer nobleness in him, and if not, thou hast done thy duty, and
the Lord judge between him and thee.</p>
<p>But Saul&rsquo;s repentance does not last.&nbsp; Soon after we
find him again hunting David in the wilderness, seemingly from 
mere caprice, and without any fresh cause of offence.&nbsp; The 
Ziphites&mdash;dwellers in the forests of the south of 
Judea&mdash;came to Saul and said, &ldquo;Doth not David hide 
himself in the hill of Hachilah.&nbsp; Then Saul arose and went 
down to the wilderness, having three thousand chosen men of 
Israel with him, to seek David in <!-- page 105--><a 
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>the 
wilderness of Ziph.&nbsp; And Saul pitched in the hill of 
Hachilah.&nbsp; But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw 
that Saul came after him into the wilderness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again 
Saul lies down to sleep&mdash;in an entrenched camp, and David 
and Abishai, his nephew, go down to the camp at night as 
spies.&nbsp; Then comes the story of my text&mdash;how Abishai 
would have slain Saul, and David forbade him to lift his hand 
against the Lord&rsquo;s anointed, and left Saul to the judgment 
of God, which he knew must come sooner or later&mdash;and merely 
took the spear from his bolster and the cruse of water to show he
had been there.</p>
<p>Once again Saul&rsquo;s heart gives way at David&rsquo;s 
nobleness: for when David and Abishai got away while Saul and his
guards all slept, David calls to Abner (verse 14-25), and rebukes
him for not having guarded his king better.&nbsp; &ldquo;Art not 
thou a valiant man?&nbsp; Wherefore, then, hast thou not kept thy
lord the king?&nbsp; The thing is not good that thou hast done: 
As the Lord liveth, ye are worthy to die, because you have not 
kept your master, the Lord&rsquo;s anointed.&nbsp; And now see 
where the king&rsquo;s spear is, and the cruse of water that was 
at his bolster.&nbsp; And Saul knew David&rsquo;s voice, and 
said, Is this thy voice, my son David?&nbsp; And David said, It 
is my voice, my lord, O king.&nbsp; Wherefore does my lord then 
thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done?&nbsp; Now 
therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth, for the king of 
Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a 
partridge.&nbsp; Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son 
David, for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was 
precious in thine eyes.&nbsp; Behold, I have played the fool, and
have erred exceedingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But David can trust him no longer.&nbsp; Weak, violent, <!-- 
page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
106</span>and capricious, Saul&rsquo;s repentance is real for the
time, but it does not last.&nbsp; He means what he says at the 
moment; but when some fresh base suspicion crosses his mind, his 
promises and his repentance are all forgotten.&nbsp; A terrible 
trial it is to David, to have his noble forgiveness and 
forbearance again and again bring forth no fruit&mdash;to have to
do with a man whom he cannot trust.&nbsp; There are few sorer 
trials than that for living man.&nbsp; Few which tempt him more 
to throw away faith and patience, and say, &ldquo;I cannot submit
to this misconduct over and over again.&nbsp; It must end, and I 
will end it, by some desperate action, right or wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, in fact, it does seem as if David was very near yielding 
to temptation, the last and worst temptation which befalls men in
his situation&mdash;to turn traitor and renegade, to go over to 
the enemies of his country and fight with them against 
Saul.&nbsp; That has happened too often to men in David&rsquo;s 
place; who have so ended a glorious career in shame and 
confusion.&nbsp; And we find that David does at last very nearly 
fall into it.&nbsp; It creeps on him, little by little, as it has
on other men in his place, but it does creep on.&nbsp; He loses 
patience and hope.&nbsp; He says, I shall perish one day by the 
hand of Saul, and he goes down into the low country, to the 
Philistines, whose champion, Goliath, he had killed, and makes 
friends with them.&nbsp; And Achish, king of Gath, gives him a 
town called Ziklag, to live in, he and his men.&nbsp; From it he 
goes out and attacks the wild Arabs, the Amalekites.&nbsp; And 
then he tells lies to Achish, saying, that he has been attacking 
his own countrymen, the Jews.&nbsp; And by that lie he brings 
himself into a very great strait&mdash;as all men who tell lies 
are sure to do.</p>
<p>When Achish and his Philistines go next to fight <!-- page 
107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
107</span>against the Jews, Achish asks David and his men to go 
with him and his army.&nbsp; And then begins a very dark 
story.&nbsp; What David meant to do we are not told; but one 
thing is clear, that whatever he did, he must have disgraced 
himself for ever, if God had not had mercy on him.&nbsp; He is 
forced to go.&nbsp; For he can give no reason why he should 
not.&nbsp; So he goes; and in the rear with the Philistine king, 
in the post of honour, as his bodyguard.&nbsp; What is he to 
do?&nbsp; If he fights against his own people, he covers himself 
with eternal shame, and loses his chance of ever being 
king.&nbsp; If he turns against Achish and his Philistines in the
battle he covers himself with eternal shame likewise, for they 
had helped him in his distress, and given him a home.</p>
<p>But God has mercy on him.&nbsp; The lords of the Philistines 
take offence at his being there, and say that he will play 
traitor to them in the battle (which was but too likely), and 
force king Achish to send him home to Ziklag, and so God delivers
him out of the trap which he has set for himself, by lying.</p>
<p>But God punishes him on the spot.&nbsp; When he comes back to 
his town, it is burnt with fire, utterly desolate, a heap of 
blackened ruins, without a living soul therein.&nbsp; And now the
end is coming, though David thinks not of it.&nbsp; He had 
committed his cause to God.&nbsp; He had said, when Saul lay 
sleeping at his feet, and Abishai would have smitten him through,
&ldquo;Who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord&rsquo;s 
anointed.&nbsp; As the Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite him, or 
he shall come to die, or he shall go down into battle and 
perish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And on the third day a man&mdash;a heathen 
Amalekite&mdash;comes to Ziklag to David with his clothes rent, 
and earth upon his head.&nbsp; Israel has been defeated in <!-- 
page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
108</span>Mount Gilboa with a great slaughter.&nbsp; The people 
far and wide have fled from Hermon across the plain, and the 
Philistines have taken possession, cutting the land of Israel in 
two.&nbsp; And Saul and Jonathan, his son, are dead.&nbsp; The 
Amalekite has proof of it.&nbsp; There is the crown which was on 
Saul&rsquo;s head, and the bracelet that was on his arm.&nbsp; He
has brought them to David to curry favour with him.&nbsp; Saul, 
he says, was wounded, and asked him to kill him (2 Sam. i. 
6-10).&nbsp; It is a lie.&nbsp; Saul had killed himself, falling 
on his own sword, to escape torture and insult from the 
Philistines, and the Amalekite is caught in his own trap.&nbsp; 
Out of his own mouth will David judge him.&nbsp; How dare he 
stretch forth his hand against the Lord&rsquo;s anointed?&nbsp; 
Let one of the young men fall on him, and kill him.&nbsp; And so 
the wretch dies.</p>
<p>And then bursts forth all the nobleness of David&rsquo;s 
heart.&nbsp; He thinks of Saul no longer as the tyrant who has 
hunted him for years, who has put on him the last and worst 
insult of taking away his wife, and giving her to another 
man.&nbsp; He thinks of him only as his master, his king, the 
grand and terrible warrior, the terror of Ammonites, Amalekites, 
and Philistines, the deliverer of his country in many a bloody 
fight, and he bursts out into that fine old lamentation over Saul
and Jonathan, sentences of which have been proverbs in the mouths
of men to this day.&nbsp; &ldquo;How are the mighty fallen!&nbsp;
Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; 
lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters
of the uncircumcised triumph.&nbsp; Ye mountains of Gilboa, let 
there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields 
of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast 
away, <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the shield of Saul, as though he had
not been anointed with oil.&nbsp; From the blood of the slain, 
from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, 
and the sword of Saul returned not empty.&nbsp; Saul and Jonathan
were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they 
were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were 
stronger than lions.&nbsp; Ye daughters of Israel, weep over 
Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on
ornaments of gold upon your apparel.&nbsp; How are the mighty 
fallen in the midst of the battle!&nbsp; O Jonathan, thou wast 
slain in thine high places.&nbsp; I am distressed for thee, my 
brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love 
to me was wonderful, passing the love of woman.&nbsp; How are the
mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!&rdquo; (2 Sam. i.
19-27).</p>
<p>Let each and every one of us, my friends, imitate 
David&rsquo;s loyalty, and be true to our duty, true to our 
masters, true to our country and true to our queen, through 
whatever trials and temptations.&nbsp; Above all, let us learn 
from David to obey; and remember that to obey we need not become 
cringing and slavish, or give up independence and high 
spirit.&nbsp; David did neither.&nbsp; Unless you learn to obey, 
as David did, you will never learn to rule.&nbsp; Imitate 
David&mdash;and so you will imitate David&rsquo;s greater son, 
even our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; For herein David is a type of 
Christ.</p>
<p>One might say truly that David&rsquo;s spirit was in 
Christ&mdash;if the very opposite was not the fact, that the 
spirit of Christ was in David, even the spirit of loyalty and 
obedience, toward God and man.&nbsp; The spirit which made our 
Lord fulfil the whole law of Moses&mdash;though quite 
unnecessary, of course, for him&mdash;simply because <!-- page 
110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>He
had chosen to be born a Jew, under Moses&rsquo; law; the spirit 
which made Him obedient to the ordinance of the country in which 
He was born, made Him even pay tribute to C&aelig;sar, the 
heathen conqueror, because the powers that ruled, were ordained 
of God.&nbsp; And yet that same spirit kept Him lofty and 
independent, high-minded and pure-minded.&nbsp; He could tell the
people to observe and to do all that the scribes and Pharisees 
told them to do, because they sat in Moses&rsquo; seat, and yet 
He could call those very scribes and Pharisees hypocrites, who 
made the law of no effect, and were bringing on themselves utter 
destruction.</p>
<p>That spirit, too, made Him loyal and obedient to God His 
Father in heaven.&nbsp; Doing not His own will, but the will of 
the Father who sent Him.&nbsp; Of Him it is written, that though 
He were a Son, yet learned He &ldquo;obedience by the things 
which He suffered;&rdquo; and that He received the perfect reward
of perfect loyalty, because He had humbled and emptied Himself, 
and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross.&nbsp;
Therefore God highly exalted Him, and gave Him a name which is 
above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should 
bow, of things in heaven, of things in the earth, and things 
under the earth, and every tongue confess that He is Lord and 
God, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
<p>This is a great mystery!&nbsp; How can we understand it?&nbsp;
How can we understand the Divine and eternal bond between Father 
and Son?&nbsp; But this at least we can understand, that loyalty 
and obedience are Divine virtues, part of the likeness of Jesus 
Christ, the eternal Son of God, and therefore divine graces, the 
gift of God&rsquo;s holy Spirit.</p>
<p><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>May God pour out upon us that Spirit, as He poured it 
out on David, and make us loyal and obedient to our queen, and to
all whom He has set over us; and loyal and obedient above all to 
Christ our heavenly king, and to God the Father, in whom we live,
and move, and have our being.</p>
<h2><!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>XV.&nbsp; DAVID&rsquo;S DEATH 
SONG.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And David spake unto the Lord the words of 
this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the 
hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: And he 
said, The Lord is my rock, and my fortress and my deliverer; the 
God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the 
horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; 
thou savest me from violence.&rdquo;&mdash;2 <span 
class="smcap">Sam.</span> xxii. 1-3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the death song of David; the last words of the great 
man&mdash;warrior, statesman, king, poet, prophet.&nbsp; A man of
many joys and many sorrows, many virtues, and many crimes; but 
through them all, every inch a man.&nbsp; A man&mdash;heaped by 
God with every gift of body, and mind, and heart, and especially 
with strong and deep intense feeling.&nbsp; Right or wrong, he is
never hard, never shallow, never light-minded.&nbsp; He is in 
earnest.&nbsp; Whatever happens to him, for good or evil, goes to
his heart, and fills his whole soul, till it comes out again in 
song.</p>
<p>This it is which makes David the Psalmist.&nbsp; This it is 
which makes the Psalter a text book still for every soldier or 
sailor, for all men who have human hearts in them.&nbsp; This it 
is which will make his psalms live for ever.&nbsp; Because they 
are full of humanity, of the spirit of man, awakened and 
enlightened, and ennobled, by the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Looking through these psalms of David, one is struck <!-- page
113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
113</span>with astonishment at their variety.&nbsp; At what is 
called the versatility of his mind, that is, his ability to turn 
himself to every kind of subject, as it comes before him, and to 
sing of it&mdash;as man has never sung since.&nbsp; And one is 
the more astonished, when one remembers that many of the most 
beautiful of these Psalms must have been written while David was 
still a very young man.&nbsp; Though we have them, of course, 
only in a translation&mdash;though many of the words and phrases 
in them are difficult, sometimes impossible to understand, though
they were written in a kind of verse which would give our English
ears no pleasure, and were set to a music so utterly different 
from our own, that it would not sound like music to us.&nbsp; 
Yet, with all these disadvantages, they are beautiful as they 
stand, they sink into the ear, and into the heart, as what they 
are, the words of one inspired by God, who found beauty in every 
sight which he beheld, in every event which happened, even in 
every sorrow and every struggle in his own soul, and could sing 
of each and all of them in words and thoughts fresh from God, the
fountain of all beauty and all truth.</p>
<p>But the peculiarity of David&rsquo;s psalms, after all, is 
from his intense faith in God.&nbsp; God is in all his 
thoughts.&nbsp; God is near him, guiding him, trying him, 
educating him, punishing him, sometimes he thinks for a moment, 
deserting him.&nbsp; But even then his mind is still full of 
God.&nbsp; It is God he wants, and the light of God&rsquo;s 
countenance, without which he cannot live, and leaving him in 
misery, and shame, and darkness, and out of the darkness he 
cries&mdash;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&nbsp; And,
therefore, everything which happens to him shapes itself not into
mere poetry, but into a prayer, or a hymn.</p>
<p>It is this which has made David for Christians now, <!-- page 
114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>as
well as for Jews of old, the great master and teacher of heart 
religion.&nbsp; In the early church, in the middle ages, as now, 
Catholic alike and Protestant, whosoever has feared God and 
sought after righteousness; whosoever has known and sorrowed over
the sinfulness and weakness of his own heart; whosoever has 
believed that the Lord God was dealing with him as with a son, 
educating him, chastening him, purifying him and teaching him, by
the chances and changes of his mortal life; whosoever, I say, has
had any real taste of vital experimental religion&mdash;to 
David&rsquo;s Psalms he has gone, as to a treasure house, to find
there his own feelings, his own doubts, his own joys, his own 
thoughts of God and His providence&mdash;reflected as in a glass;
everything which he would say, said for him already, in words 
which will never be equalled on earth.</p>
<p>There are psalms among them of bitter agony, cries as of a 
lost child, like that 6th psalm&mdash;&ldquo;Oh Lord, rebuke me 
not in Thine anger, neither chasten me in Thy hot 
displeasure,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; And yet ending like that, with 
a sudden flash of faith, and hope, and joy, which is a peculiar 
mark of David&rsquo;s character, faith in God triumphing over all
the chances and changes of mortal life.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord 
hath heard the voice of my weeping.&nbsp; The Lord will receive 
my prayer, all mine enemies shall be confounded and sore 
vexed.&nbsp; They shall be turned back and put to 
shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are psalms again which are prayers for guidance and 
teaching like the 5th Psalm&mdash;&ldquo;Lead me, O Lord, in thy 
righteousness because of mine enemies: make thy way plain before 
my face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are psalms, again, of Natural Religion, such as the 8th 
and the 19th and the 29th, the words <!-- page 115--><a 
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>of a man 
who had watched and studied nature by day and night, as he kept 
his sheep upon the mountains, and wandered in the desert with his
men.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will consider thy heavens, the works of thy 
hand, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained . . . the 
fowls of the air and the fishes of the sea&rdquo; . . . (Ps. 
viii. 3-8).&nbsp; &ldquo;The heavens declare the glory of God: 
and the firmament sheweth his handi-work&rdquo; (Ps. xix. 
1-6).&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the Lord that commandeth the water: it 
is the glorious God that maketh the thunder: it is the Lord that 
ruleth the sea: the voice of the Lord breaketh the cedar trees: 
the voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire: the voice of 
the Lord shaketh the wilderness: the Lord sitteth above the water
flood,&rdquo; &amp;c. (Ps. xxix.).</p>
<p>There are psalms of deep religious experience like the 
32d.&mdash;&ldquo;Blessed is he whose unrighteousness is 
forgiven, and whose sin is covered . . . Thou art a place to hide
me in. . . . Thy hand is heavy upon me day and night . . . I will
acknowledge my sin unto Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are psalms, and these are almost the most important of 
all, such as the 9th, the 24th and 36th Psalms, which declare the
providence and the kingdom of the Living God, with that great and
prophetic 2d Psalm (ver. 1-5): &ldquo;Why do the heathen so 
furiously rage together, and the people imagine vain 
things.&nbsp; The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers 
take counsel together against the Lord, and against his 
anointed,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>There are psalms of deep repentance, of the broken and the 
contrite heart, like that famous 51st Psalm, which is used in all
Christian churches to this day, as the expression of all true 
repentance, and which, even in our translation, by its awful 
simplicity, its slow sadness, expresses <!-- page 116--><a 
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>in its very
sound the utterly crushed and broken heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have 
mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness, according to the 
multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences. . . . Behold, I 
was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive. . . . 
The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit, a broken and a 
contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Then there are psalms, like the 26th, of a manful and stately 
confidence.&nbsp; The words of one who is determined to do right,
who feels that on the whole he is doing it, and is not ashamed to
say so.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be thou my judge, for I have walked 
innocently. . . . Examine and prove me: try out my reins and my 
heart.&nbsp; I have not dwelt with vain persons, neither will I 
have fellowship with the deceitful. . . . I have hated the 
congregation of the wicked.&nbsp; I have loved the habitation of 
thy house.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are political psalms, full of 
weighty advice, to his sons after him, like the 115th Psalm.</p>
<p>There are psalms of the most exquisite tenderness, like the 
23d Psalm, written perhaps while he himself was still a shepherd 
boy, and he looked upon his flocks feeding on the downs of 
Bethlehem, and sang, &ldquo;The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not 
want,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; And lastly, though I should not say 
lastly, for the variety of this wonderful man&rsquo;s psalms is 
past counting, there are psalms of triumph and thanksgiving, 
which are miracles of beauty and grandeur.&nbsp; Take, for 
instance, the 34th, one of the earliest, when David was not more 
than twenty-five years old, when Abimelech drove him away, and he
departed and sang, &ldquo;I will bless the Lord at all times. . .
. My soul shall make her boast in the Lord. . . . I sought the 
Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me out of all my fear.&nbsp;
Lo the poor man <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>crieth and the Lord heareth him. . .
. The angel of the Lord tarrieth round about them that fear him, 
and delivereth them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, as the grandest of all, 
as, indeed, it was meant to be, that wonderful 18th Psalm which 
David, the servant of the Lord, spake to the Lord in the day when
the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I will love thee, O Lord, my strength.&nbsp; The Lord is 
my strong rock and defence: my Saviour, my God, and my might, in 
whom I will trust, my buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and
my refuge.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is, indeed, David&rsquo;s 
masterpiece.&nbsp; The only one which comes near it is the 
144th.&nbsp; The loftiest piece of poetry, taken as mere poetry, 
though it is more, much more, in the whole world.&nbsp; Even in 
our translation, it rushes on with a force and a swiftness, which
are indeed divine.&nbsp; Thought follows thought, image image, 
verse verse, before the breath of the Spirit of God, as wave 
leaps after wave before a mighty wind.&nbsp; Even now, to read 
that psalm rightly, should stir the heart like a trumpet.&nbsp; 
What must it have been like when sung by David himself?&nbsp; No 
wonder that those brave old Jews hung upon the lips of their 
warrior-poet and felt that the man who could sing to them of such
thoughts, and not only sing them, but feel them likewise, was 
indeed a king and a prophet sent to them by God.&nbsp; A prophet,
I say.&nbsp; They loved his songs not merely on account of the 
beauty of their poetry.&nbsp; Indeed, one hardly likes to talk of
David&rsquo;s psalms as beautiful poetry.&nbsp; It seems unfair 
to them.&nbsp; For though they are beautiful poetry, they are far
more, they are prophecy and preaching concerning God.&nbsp; They 
preach and declare to the Jews the Living God.&nbsp; They are the
speech of a man whose thoughts and works were begun, <!-- page 
118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
118</span>continued, and ended in God.&nbsp; A man who knew that 
God was about his path, and about his bed, and spying out all his
ways.&nbsp; A man whose one fixed idea was, that God was leading 
and guiding him through life.&nbsp; That idea, &ldquo;The Lord 
leads me,&rdquo; is the key-note of David&rsquo;s psalms, and 
makes them what they are, an inspired revelation of Almighty 
God.</p>
<p>But is that idea true?&nbsp; Of course, you answer, it is 
true, because it is in the Bible.&nbsp; But that is not the 
question.&nbsp; That is rather putting the question aside, which 
is, Do <i>we</i> believe it to be true, and find it to be 
true?&nbsp; We believe that God was leading David because we read
it in the Bible.&nbsp; But do we believe that God is leading 
<i>us</i>?&nbsp; If not, what is the use of our reading 
David&rsquo;s psalms, either in private or publicly in church 
every Sunday?&nbsp; You all know how largely we use them, but 
why?&nbsp; If we are not in the same case as David was, what 
right have we to take David&rsquo;s words into our mouths?&nbsp; 
We do not fancy that there is any magical virtue in repeating the
same words, as foolish people used to repeat charms and 
spells.&nbsp; Our only right, our only excuse for saying or 
singing David&rsquo;s psalms in public or in private, must be, 
that as David was, so are we in this world, under the continual 
guidance of God.</p>
<p>And therefore it is that the Church bids us to use these 
psalms in our devotions, day by day, all the year 
round&mdash;that we may know that our God is David&rsquo;s God, 
our temptations David&rsquo;s temptations, our fears 
David&rsquo;s fears, our hopes David&rsquo;s hopes, our struggles
and triumphs over what is wrong in our hearts and in the world 
around us, are the same as David&rsquo;s.&nbsp; That we are not 
to fancy, because David was an inspired prophet, that therefore 
he was in a different case from us, of different <!-- page 
119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
119</span>passions from ours, or that his words are too sacred 
and holy for us to use.&nbsp; Not so, we are to believe the very 
contrary.&nbsp; We are to believe that no prophecy of Scripture 
is of any private interpretation&mdash;that is&mdash;has not 
merely to do with the man who spoke it first&mdash;but that 
because David spoke by the Spirit of God, who is no respecter of 
persons, therefore his words apply to you, and to me, and to 
every human being&mdash;that David is revealing to us the 
everlasting laws of God&rsquo;s Spirit, and of God&rsquo;s 
providence, whereby He works alike in every Christian soul, and 
then, therefore, whatever our sin may be, whatever our sorrows 
may be, whatever our station in life may be, we have a right to 
offer up to God our repentance, our doubts, our fears, our hopes,
our thanksgivings, in the very words which David used two 
thousand years and more ago, certain that they are the right 
words, better words than we can find for ourselves, exactly 
fitting our own souls, and fitting too the mind and will of 
Almighty God, because they are inspired by the same Spirit of God
who descended on us, when we were baptized unto Christ&rsquo;s 
Church.</p>
<p>And for that, my friends, we have an example&mdash;as we have 
for everything else&mdash;in our Lord Jesus Christ Himself.&nbsp;
For He, in the hour of His darkest agony, when He hung upon the 
cross for our sins, and the sin of all mankind, and when (worse 
than all other agony, or shame), there came over Him the deepest 
horror of all&mdash;the feeling, but for a moment, that God had 
forsaken Him&mdash;even then, He who spake as never man spake, 
did not disdain to use the words of David, and cry, in the 
opening verse of that 22d psalm, every line of which applies so 
strangely to Him himself, <!-- page 120--><a 
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>&ldquo;My 
God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?&rdquo;&nbsp; So did our 
Lord bequeath, as it were, with His dying breath, to all 
Christians for ever, as the fit and true expression of all that 
they should ever experience, the psalms of His great earthly 
ancestor, David, the sweet singer of Israel.</p>
<p>My friends, neglect not that precious bequest of your dying 
Lord.&nbsp; Read those psalms, study them, tune your hearts and 
minds to them more and more; and you will find in them an

MICAIAH&mdash;THE CHRISTIAN DEAD ALIVE FOE EVERMORE.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And the King of Israel said to Jehosaphat, 
There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may 
enquire of the Lord: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy 
good concerning me, but evil.&rdquo; . . .&mdash;1 <span 
class="smcap">Kings</span> xxii. 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you read the story of Micaiah the Prophet, and King Ahab in
the 22d chapter of the 1st Book of Kings, you will, I think, 
agree that Ahab showed himself as foolish as he was wicked.&nbsp;
He hated Micaiah for telling him the truth.&nbsp; And when he 
heard the truth and was warned of his coming end, he went 
stupidly to meet it, and died as the fool dies.&nbsp; Foolishness
and wickedness often go hand in hand.&nbsp; Certainly they did in
that miserable king&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>But now, my friends, while we find fault with wretched Ahab, 
let us take care that we are not finding fault with ourselves 
also.&nbsp; If we do what Ahab did, we have no right to despise 
him for doing what we do.&nbsp; With what judgment we judge we 
shall be judged, and the same measure which we measure out to 
Ahab, God will measure out to us.&nbsp; All these things are 
written for our example, that we may see our faults in other men,
as in a glass, and seeing how ugly sin and folly is, and to what 
misery it leads, may learn to avoid it, and look at home, and see
that we are not treading the same path.&nbsp; <!-- page 122--><a 
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>Else what 
use in reading these stories of good men and bad men of old 
times?&nbsp; The very use of them is to make us remember that 
they were men of like passions with ourselves, and learn from 
their example; as we may do easily enough from that of Ahab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There remaineth yet one prophet&mdash;but I hate 
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; How often have we said that in our 
hearts!&nbsp; Do you think not?&nbsp; Let me show you then.</p>
<p>How often when we are in trouble or anxiety do we go 
everywhere to get comfort, before we go to God&rsquo;s 
word?&nbsp; When a young lad falls into wild ways, and gets into 
trouble by his own folly, then to whom does he go for 
comfort?&nbsp; Too often, to other wild lads like himself, or to 
foolish and wicked women, who will flatter him, and try to make 
him easy in his sins, and say to him as the false prophets said 
to Ahab, &ldquo;Go on and prosper&mdash;why be afraid?&nbsp; Why 
should you not enjoy yourself?&nbsp; Never mind what your father 
and mother say, never mind what the parson says.&nbsp; You will 
do well enough.&nbsp; All will come right somehow.&nbsp; Come and
drink, and drive away sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all the while the poor lad gets no comfort from these 
false friends.&nbsp; He likes to listen to them, because they 
flatter him up in his sins; but all the while his heart is 
heavy.&nbsp; Like Ahab, he has a secret fear that all will 
<i>not</i> come right; he feels that he will <i>not</i> do well 
enough; and he knows that there remaineth yet a prophet of the 
Lord, who will not prophesy good of him but evil&mdash;and that 
is the Bible, and the prayer-book, and the sermon he hears at 
church&mdash;and therefore he hates them.&nbsp; And so, many a 
time he will not go to church for fear of hearing there that he 
is wrong, perhaps something in the sermon, which hits him hard, 
<!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
123</span>and makes him ashamed of himself, and angry with the 
preacher.&nbsp; So for fear of hearing the truth, and having his 
sins set before his face, he stays away from church, and passes 
his Sundays like a heathen, because he has no mind to repent and 
mend, and be a good Christian.</p>
<p>Foolish fellow!&nbsp; As if he could escape God&rsquo;s 
judgment by shutting his ears to it.&nbsp; As well try to stop 
the thunder from rolling in the sky, by stopping his ears to 
that!&nbsp; The thunder is there, whether he choose to hear it or
not.&nbsp; And whether he comes to church or not, God&rsquo;s law
stands sure, that the wages of sin is death.&nbsp; Does the man 
fancy that God&rsquo;s law is shut up within the church walls, 
and that so he can keep clear of it by staying away from 
church?&nbsp; My friends, God&rsquo;s law is over the whole 
country, and over every cottage and field in it&mdash;about our 
path and about our bed, and spying out all our ways.&nbsp; The 
darkness is no darkness to God.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s judgments are 
in all the earth; and whether or not we choose to find them out, 
they will find us out just the same, as they found out Ahab, when
his cup was full, and his time was come.</p>
<p>How many a poor lad, too, who has got into trouble, thinks he 
shall escape God&rsquo;s judgments by going across the sea; but 
he finds himself mistaken!&nbsp; He finds that the wages of sin 
are misery and shame and ruin, in Australia just as much as in 
England, and that all the gold in the diggings cannot redeem his 
soul, or prevent his being an unhappy self-condemned man if he 
does wrong.</p>
<p>How many a poor lad, too, who has got into trouble, has 
fancied that he could escape God&rsquo;s judgments by going for a
soldier, and has found out that he too was mistaken!&nbsp; 
Perhaps God&rsquo;s judgment has found him out, as it found out 
Ahab, on the field of battle, and a chance <!-- page 124--><a 
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>shot has 
taught him, as it taught Ahab, that there is no hiding-place from
the Lord who made him.&nbsp; Or perhaps God&rsquo;s judgments 
have come in fever, and hunger, and cold, and weariness, and 
miserable lonely labour; and with that hunger of body has come a 
hunger of his soul&mdash;a hunger after the bread of life, and 
the word of God!&nbsp; Ah! how many a poor fellow in his pain and
misery has longed for the crumbs which used to fall from 
God&rsquo;s table, when he was a boy at home! for a word of good 
advice, though it were never so sharp and plain spoken&mdash;or a
lesson such as he used to hear at school, or a tract, or a bit of
a book, or anybody or anything which will put his poor wandering 
soul in the right way.&nbsp; He used to hate such things when he 
was at home, because they warned him of his bad ways; but now he 
feels a strange longing for that very good talk which he hated 
once, and so like David of old, out of the deep he cries unto the
Lord.&nbsp; And when that cry comes up out of a sinful 
conscience-stricken, self-condemned heart, be sure it does not 
come up in vain.&nbsp; The Lord hears it, and the Lord answers 
it.&nbsp; Yes, I know it for certain; for many a sad and yet 
pleasant story I have heard, how brave men who went out from 
England, full of strength and health, and full of sin and folly 
too,&mdash;and there in that blood-stained Crimea, when their 
strength and their health had faded, and there was nothing round 
them or before them but wounds, and misery, and death; how there 
at last they found Christ, or rather were found by Him, and 
opened their eyes at last to see God&rsquo;s judgments for their 
sins, and confessed their own sin and God&rsquo;s justice, and 
received His precious promises of pardon, even in the agonies of 
death; and found amid the rage and noise of war, the peace of 
God, which this <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>world&rsquo;s pleasures never gave 
them, and which this world&rsquo;s wounds, and fever, and battle,
and sudden death cannot take away.</p>
<p>And after that, it matters little for a man what happens to 
him.&nbsp; For if he lives, he lives unto the Lord; and if he 
dies, he dies unto the Lord.&nbsp; He may come home, well and 
strong, once more to do his duty, where God has put him, a sadder
man perhaps, but at least a soberer and a wiser man, who has 
learnt to endure hardship, not merely as a soldier of the Queen, 
but as a good soldier of Jesus Christ too, ready to fight against
sin and wrong-doing in himself and in his neighbours.</p>
<p>Or he may come home a cripple, to be honoured and to be kept 
too (as he deserves to be) at his country&rsquo;s expense.&nbsp; 
But if he be a wise man he will not regret even the loss of a 
limb.&nbsp; That is a cheap price to pay for having gained what 
is worth all the limbs in a man&rsquo;s body, a clear conscience 
and a right life.&nbsp; &ldquo;If thy hand offend thee cut it 
off.&rdquo;&nbsp; Better to enter into life halt and maimed, as 
many a gallant man has done in war time, than having two hands 
and two feet to be cast out.</p>
<p>Or perhaps his grave is left behind there, upon those lonely 
Crimean downs, and his comrades are returning without him, and 
all whom he knew, and all whom he loved, are looking for him at 
home.&nbsp; There his grave is, and must be; and &ldquo;the foe 
and the stranger will tread on his head, and they far away on the
billow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at least he has not died like Ahab&mdash;a shameful and 
pitiable death.&nbsp; He has done his work and conquered.&nbsp; 
He has died like a man, whom men honour.&nbsp; Even so it is 
well.&nbsp; And if he have died in the Lord, a penitent Christian
man, <i>he</i> is not dead at all.&nbsp; <i>He</i> does not lie 
in that grave in a foreign land.&nbsp; All of him that <!-- page 
126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
126</span>strangers&rsquo; feet can tread upon is but what we 
called his body; and yet which was not even his body, but the 
mere husk and shell of him, the flesh and bones with which his 
body was clothed in this life; while he, he himself, is nearer 
God than ever, and nearer, too, than ever to his comrades who 
seem to have left him, and to the parents and the friends who are
weeping for him at home.&nbsp; Ay, nearer to them, more able, I 
firmly believe, to help and comfort them, now that he is alive 
for ever, in the heaven of God, than he would if he were only 
alive here on the earth of God&mdash;more able perhaps to help 
them now by his prayers than he ever would have been by the 
labour of his hands.&nbsp; Be that as it may, Blessed are the 
dead who die in the Lord, for they rest from their labours, and 
their works do follow them.&nbsp; A fearful labour is the 
soldier&rsquo;s, and an ugly work; and he has done it; and doubt 
not it has followed him, and is recorded for him in the book of 
God for ever!</p>
<h2><!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>XVII.&nbsp; WHAT IS CHANCE?</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By one man sin entered into the world, and 
death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, because all have 
sinned.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Romans</span> v. 12.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All death is a solemn and fearful thing.&nbsp; When it comes 
to an old person, one cannot help feeling it often a release, and
saying, &ldquo;He has done his work&mdash;he has sorrowed out his
sorrows, he has struggled his last struggle, and wept his last 
tear: let him go to his rest and be peaceful at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when death comes suddenly to people in the prime of life, 
who but yesterday were as busy and as lively as any of us, and we
are face to face with death, and see the same face we knew in 
life&mdash;not wasted, not worn, young and lusty as ever, 
seemingly asleep,&mdash;something at our heart as well as in our 
eyes, tells us that there is more than sleep in that strange, 
sharp, quiet smile&mdash;and we know in spite of ourselves that 
the man is dead.&nbsp; And then strange questions rise in us, 
&ldquo;Is that he whom we knew? that still piece of clay, waiting
only a few days before it returns to its dust?&nbsp; It is the 
face of him, the shape of him, it is what we knew him by.&nbsp; 
It is the very same body of which when we met it on the road we 
said, &ldquo;He is coming.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet is it 
<i>he</i>?&nbsp; Where is <i>he</i> himself?&nbsp; Can <i>he</i> 
hear us?&nbsp; Can <i>he</i> see <!-- page 128--><a 
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>us?&nbsp; 
Does <i>he</i> remember us as we remember <i>him</i>?&nbsp; 
Surely he must.&nbsp; He cannot be gone away&mdash;there he lies 
still on that bed before us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then we are ready to say to ourselves, &ldquo;It must be a
mistake, a dream.&nbsp; He cannot be dead.&nbsp; He will 
wake.&nbsp; We shall meet him to-morrow in his old place, about 
his old work.&nbsp; <i>He</i> dead?&nbsp; Impossible!&nbsp; 
Impossible to believe that we shall never see him 
again&mdash;never any more till we too die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then when such thoughts come over us, we cannot help going
on to say, &ldquo;What is this death? this horrible thing which 
takes husbands from their wives, and children from their parents,
and those who love from those who love them?&nbsp; What is 
it?&nbsp; How came this same death loose in the world?&nbsp; What
right has it here, under the bright sun, among the pleasant 
fields, this cruel, pitiless death, destroying God&rsquo;s 
handi-work, God&rsquo;s likeness, just as it is growing to its 
prime of beauty and usefulness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then&mdash;there&mdash;by the bedside of the young at 
least, we do feel that death must be God&rsquo;s enemy&mdash;that
it is a hateful, cruel, evil thing&mdash;accursed in the sight of
a loving, life-giving God, as much as it is hated by poor mortal 
man.</p>
<p>And then, we feel, there must be something wrong between man 
and God.&nbsp; Man must be fallen and corrupt, must be out of his
right place and state in some way or other, or this horrible 
death would not have got power over us!&nbsp; What right has 
death in the world, if man has not sinned or fallen?</p>
<p>And then we cannot help going further and saying, &ldquo;This 
cruel death! it may come to me, young, strong, and healthy as I 
am.&nbsp; It may come to-morrow; it may <!-- page 129--><a 
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>come this 
minute; it may come by a hundred diseases, by a hundred 
accidents, which I cannot foresee or escape, and carry me off 
to-morrow, away from all I know and all I love, and all I like to
see and to do.&nbsp; And where would it take me to, if it did 
take me?&nbsp; What should I be?&nbsp; What should I see?&nbsp; 
What should I know, after they had put this body of mine into 
that narrow house in the church-yard, and covered it out of sight
till the judgment day?&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh, my friends, what a 
thought for you, and me, and every human being!&nbsp; We might 
die to-night, even as those whom we know of died!</p>
<p>But perhaps some of you young people are saying to yourselves,
&ldquo;You are trying to frighten us, but you shall not frighten 
us.&nbsp; We know very well that it is not a common thing for a 
young person to die&mdash;not one in a hundred (except in a war 
time) dies in the prime of his years; and therefore the chances 
are that we shall not die young either.&nbsp; The chances are 
that we shall live to be old men and women, and we are not going 
to be frightened about dying forty years before our death.&nbsp; 
So in the meanwhile we will go our own way and enjoy 
ourselves.&nbsp; It will be time enough to think of death when 
death draws near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then, if you have these thoughts, I will ask you, what do
you mean by <i>chance</i>?&nbsp; You say, the <i>chances</i> are 
against your dying young.&nbsp; Pray what are these wonderful 
things called chances, which are to keep you alive for thirty or 
forty or fifty years more?&nbsp; Did you ever <i>hear</i> a 
chance, or <i>see</i> a chance?&nbsp; Or did you ever meet with 
any one who had?&nbsp; Did any one ever see a great angel called 
Chance flying about keeping people from dying?&nbsp; What is 
<i>chance</i> on which you depend as you say for your life?&nbsp;
What is <i>chance</i> which you fancy <!-- page 130--><a 
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>so much 
stronger than God?&nbsp; For as long as the <i>chance</i> is 
against your dying, you are not afraid of neglecting God and 
disobeying God, and therefore you must suppose that <i>chance</i>
is stronger than God, and quite able to keep God&rsquo;s anger 
off from you for thirty or forty years, till you choose to repent
and amend.&nbsp; What sort of thing is this wonderful chance, 
which is going to keep you alive?</p>
<p>Perhaps you will say, &ldquo;All we meant when we said that 
the chances were against our dying was that God&rsquo;s will was 
against our dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did you only mean that?&nbsp; Then why put the thought of God 
away by foolish words about chance?&nbsp; For you know that it is
God and God only who keeps you alive.&nbsp; You must look at 
that, you must face that.&nbsp; If you are alive now, God keeps 
you so.&nbsp; If you live forty years more, God will make you 
live that time.&nbsp; And He who can make you live, can also let 
you <i>not</i> live; and then you will die.&nbsp; God can 
withdraw the breath of life from you or me or any one at any 
moment.&nbsp; And then where would our <i>chances</i> of not 
dying be?&nbsp; We should die here and now, and know that God is 
the Lord and not <i>chance</i> . . .</p>
<p>But think again.&nbsp; If God makes you alive He must have 
some reason for making you alive.&nbsp; For mind&mdash;it is not 
as you fancy, that when God leaves you alone you live, and when 
He puts forth His power and visits you, you die.&nbsp; <i>Not 
that</i>, <i>but the very opposite</i>.&nbsp; For in Adam all 
die.&nbsp; Our bodies are dead by reason of sin, and in the midst
of life we are in death.&nbsp; There is a seed of death in you 
and me and every little child.&nbsp; While we are eating and 
drinking and going about our business, fancying that we cannot 
help living, we carry the seeds <!-- page 131--><a 
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>of disease 
in our own bodies, which will surely kill us some day, even if we
are not cut off before by some sudden accident.&nbsp; That is 
true, physicians know that it is true.&nbsp; Our bodies carry in 
them from the very cradle the seeds of death; and therefore it is
not because God leaves us alone that we live.&nbsp; We live 
because God, our merciful heavenly Father, <i>does not</i> leave 
us alone, but keeps down those seeds of disease and death by His 
Spirit, who is the Lord and Giver of Life.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s Spirit of Life is fighting against death in our 
bodies from the moment we are born.&nbsp; And then, as Moses 
says, when He withdraws that Spirit of His, then it is that we 
die and are turned again to our dust.&nbsp; So that our living a 
long time or a short time, does not depend on <span 
class="smcap">Chance</span>, or on our own health or 
constitution, but entirely on how long God may choose to keep 
down the death which is lying in us, ready to kill us at any 
moment, and certain to kill us sooner or later.</p>
<p>And yet people fancy that they live because they cannot help 
living, unless God interferes with them and makes them die.&nbsp;
They fancy, thoughtless and ignorant as they are, that when they 
are in <i>health</i>, God leaves them alone, and that therefore 
when they are in health they may leave God alone.</p>
<p>My friends, I tell you that it is God, and not our 
constitution or chance either which keeps you alive; as you will 
surely find out the moment after the last breath has left your 
body.&nbsp; And therefore I ask you solemnly the plain question, 
&ldquo;For what does God keep you alive?&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>For 
what</i>?&nbsp; Will a man keep plants in his garden which bear 
neither fruit nor flowers?&nbsp; Will a man keep stock on his 
farm which will only eat and never make profit; or a servant in 
his house who will not work?&nbsp; <!-- page 132--><a 
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Much more, 
will a man keep a servant who will not only be idle himself, but 
quarrel with his fellow servants, lead them into sin and shame, 
and teach them to disobey their master?&nbsp; What man in his 
senses would keep such plants, such stock, such servants?&nbsp; 
And yet God keeps hundreds and thousands in His garden and in His
house for years and years, while they are doing no good to Him, 
and doing harm to those around them.</p>
<p>How many are there who never yet did one thing to make their 
companions better, and yet have done many a thing to make their 
companions worse!&nbsp; Then why are they alive still?&nbsp; Why 
does not God rid Himself of them at once and let them die, 
instead of cumbering the ground?&nbsp; I know but one 
reason.&nbsp; If they were only God&rsquo;s plants, or His stock,
or His servants, He might rid Himself of them.&nbsp; But they are
something far nearer and dearer to Him than that.&nbsp; They are 
His children, and therefore He has mercy on them.&nbsp; They are 
redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Lamb slain 
before the foundation of the world; and therefore for the sake of
the Lord Jesus Christ, God looks on them with long-suffering and 
tender loving-kindness.&nbsp; Man was made in God&rsquo;s 
likeness at first, and was the son of God.&nbsp; And therefore 
howsoever fallen and corrupt man&rsquo;s nature is now, yet God 
loves him still, even though he be a heathen or an infidel.&nbsp;
How much more for you, my friends, who know that you are 
God&rsquo;s children, who have been declared to be His children 
by Holy Baptism, and grafted into Christ&rsquo;s church.&nbsp; 
You at least are bound to believe that God preserves you from 
death, <i>because He loves you</i>.&nbsp; He protects you every 
day and every hour, as a father takes care of His children, and 
keeps them out of dangers which they cannot see or 
understand.</p>
<p><!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>Yes! this is plain truth&mdash;your heavenly Father is 
keeping you alive!&nbsp; Oh, do not make that truth an excuse for
forgetting and disobeying your heavenly Father!</p>
<p>Why does He keep you alive?&nbsp; Surely because He expects 
something of you.&nbsp; And what does He expect of you?&nbsp; 
What does any good father expect of his children?&nbsp; Why does 
he help and protect them?&nbsp; Not from mere brute instinct, as 
beasts take care of their young when they are little, and then as
soon as they are grown up cast them off and forget them.&nbsp; 
No.&nbsp; He takes care of his children because he wishes them to
grow up like himself, to be a comfort and a help and a pride to 
him.</p>
<p>And God takes care of <i>you</i> and keeps you from death, for
the very same reason.&nbsp; God desires that you should grow up 
like Himself, godly and pure, leading lives like His Son Jesus 
Christ.&nbsp; God desires that you should grow up to the stature 
of perfect men and women, which is the likeness of Jesus Christ 
your Lord.</p>
<p>But if you turn God&rsquo;s grace in keeping you alive into a 
cloak for licentiousness and an excuse for sinning&mdash;if, when
God keeps you alive that you may lead <i>good</i> lives, you take
advantage of His fatherly love to lead <i>bad</i> lives&mdash;if 
you go on returning God evil for good, and ungratefully and 
basely presume on His patience and love to do the things which He
hates, what must you expect?&nbsp; God loves you, and you make 
that an excuse for not loving Him; God does everything for you, 
and you make that an excuse for doing nothing for God; God gives 
you health and strength, and you make that an excuse for using 
your health and strength just in the way He has forbidden.&nbsp; 
What can be more ungrateful?&nbsp; What can <!-- page 134--><a 
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>be more 
foolish?&nbsp; Oh, my friends, if one of our children behaved to 
us in return for our care and love a hundredth part as shamefully
as most of us behave to God our Father, what should we think of 
them?&nbsp; What should we say of them?</p>
<p>Oh, beware, beware!&nbsp; God is a righteous God, strong and 
patient, and God is provoked every day, and bears it according to
His boundless love and patience.&nbsp; But &ldquo;if a man 
<i>will not</i> turn,&rdquo; says the same text, &ldquo;He will 
whet His sword.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then&mdash;woe to the careless 
and ungrateful sinner.&nbsp; God will cut him down and bring him 
low.&nbsp; God will take from him his health, or his money, or 
his blind peace of mind; and by affliction after affliction, and 
shame after shame, and disappointment after disappointment, teach
him that his youth, and his health, and his money, and all that 
he has, are his Father&rsquo;s gifts and not his own 
property&mdash;and that His Father will take them away from him, 
till he feels his own weakness, till he sees that he is really 
not his own but God&rsquo;s property, body and soul, and goes 
back to his heavenly Father and cries, &ldquo;Father, I have 
sinned against heaven and before Thee, and am no more worthy to 
be called Thy son.&nbsp; I have taken Thy gifts and gone away 
with them from Thy house unto the far country of sin, and wasted 
them in riotous living, till I have had to fill my belly with the
husks which the swine did eat.&nbsp; I have had no profit out of 
all my sins, of which I am now ashamed.&nbsp; I have robbed Thee 
and abused Thy gifts and Thy love.&nbsp; Father, take me back, 
for I have sinned, and am not worthy to be called Thy 
child.&rdquo;</p>

19.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did it ever strike you as a very remarkable and important 
thing, that after saying in Proverbs iii. that Wisdom is this 
precious treasure, and bidding his son seek for her because 
(verse 16) &ldquo;Length of days is in her right hand, and in her
left hand riches and honour: Her ways are ways of pleasantness, 
and all her paths are peace,&rdquo;&mdash;Solomon goes on 
immediately to say (verses 19, 20), &ldquo;The Lord by Wisdom 
hath founded the earth, and established the heavens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By Wisdom: by the very same Wisdom, Solomon says, which is to 
give men length of days, and riches, and honour.&nbsp; Is not 
this curious at least?&nbsp; That there is but one wisdom for God
and man?&nbsp; That man&rsquo;s true wisdom is a pattern of 
God&rsquo;s wisdom?&nbsp; That a man to prosper in the world must
get the very same wisdom by which God made and rules the 
world?&nbsp; Curious.&nbsp; But most blessed news, my friends, if

name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>Many of you
of course know what it means.&nbsp; That it means wisdom and 
learning about this earth and all things in it.&nbsp; Many more 
of you of course know that in the last hundred years science has 
improved in a most wonderful way, and is improving every day; 
that we have now gas-lights, steam-engines, cotton-mills, 
railroads, electric telegraphs, iron ships, and a hundred curious
and useful machines and manufactures of which our 
great-grandfathers never dreamed; that our knowledge of different
countries, of medicines, of the laws of health and disease, and 
of all in short which has to do with man&rsquo;s bodily life, is 
increasing day by day; and that all these discoveries are very 
great blessings; they give employment and food to millions who 
would otherwise have had nothing to do; they bring vast wealth 
into this country, and all the countries which trade with 
us.&nbsp; They enable this land of England to support four times 
as many human beings as it did two hundred years ago; they make 
many of the necessaries of life cheaper, so that in many cases a 
poor man may now have comforts which his grandfather never heard 
of.</p>
<p>I know that there is a dark side to this picture; that with 
all this increase of wisdom, there has come conceit, and trust in
deceitful riches, and want of trust in God, and obedience to His 
law.&nbsp; I know that in some things we are not better, but 
worse than our forefathers; God forgive us for it!&nbsp; But the 
good came from God; and that man is very unwise and unthankful 
too, who despises God&rsquo;s great gift of science, because 
fallen man has defiled His gift as it passed through his unclean 
hands.</p>
<p>Look only at this one thing, as I said just now, that by all 
these wonderful discoveries and improvements, <!-- page 137--><a 
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>England is 
able to support four times as many Englishmen as it used of old, 
and that, if we feared God, and sought His kingdom better, I 
believe, England would support many more people yet&mdash;and see
if <i>that</i> be not a thing to thank Almighty God for every day
of our lives.</p>
<p>Now how did this wonderful change and improvement take 
place&mdash;suddenly, and, as it were, in the course of the last 
hundred years?&nbsp; Simply by mankind understanding the text 
(Prov. iii. 19), and by obeying it.&nbsp; I tell you a real 
truth, my friends, and it happened thus.</p>
<p>For more than sixteen hundred years after our Lord&rsquo;s 
time, mankind seem to have become hardly any wiser about earthly 
things, nay, even to have gone back.&nbsp; The land was no better
tilled; goods were no more easily made; diseases were no better 
cured, than they had been sixteen hundred years before.&nbsp; And
if any learned men longed to become very wise and cunning, and to
get power over this world and the things in it, they flew off to 
witchcraft, charms, and magic, deceived by the devil&rsquo;s old 
lie, that the kingdom and the power and the glory of this world 
belonged to him and not to God.</p>
<p>But about two hundred and fifty years ago, it pleased God to 
open the eyes of one of the wisest men who ever lived, who was 
called Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, Lord Chancellor of England, 
and to show him the real and right way of learning by which men 
can fulfil God&rsquo;s command to replenish the earth and subdue 
it.&nbsp; And Francis Bacon told all the learned men boldly that 
they had all been wrong together, and that their wisdom was no 
better than a sort of madness, as it is written, &ldquo;The 
wisdom of man is foolishness with God;&rdquo; that the only <!-- 
page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
138</span>way for man to be wise was to get God&rsquo;s wisdom, 
the wisdom with which He had founded the earth, and find out 
God&rsquo;s laws by which He had made this world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you can do that, 
you will be able to imitate God in your own small way.&nbsp; If 
you learn the laws by which God made all things, you will be able
to invent new things for yourselves.&nbsp; <i>For you can only 
subdue nature by obeying her</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was one of 
his greatest sayings, and by it he meant, that you can only 
subdue a thing and make it useful to you, by finding out the 
rules by which God made that thing, and by obeying them.</p>
<p>For instance, you cannot subdue and till a barren field, and 
make it useful, without knowing and obeying the laws and rules of
that soil; and then you can subdue and conquer that field, and 
change and train it, as I may say, to grow what you like.&nbsp; 
You cannot conquer diseases without knowing and obeying the laws 
by which God has made man&rsquo;s body, and the laws by which 
fever and cholera and other plagues come.</p>
<p>Let me give you another instance.&nbsp; You all have seen 
lightning conductors, which prevent tall chimneys and steeples 
from being struck by storms, so that the lightning runs harmless 
downward.&nbsp; Now we can all see how this is conquering the 
force of lightning in a wonderful and beautiful way.&nbsp; But 
before you can conquer the lightning by a conductor, you must 
obey the lightning and its laws most carefully.&nbsp; If you make
the conductor out of your own head and fancy, it will be of no 
use.&nbsp; You must observe and follow humbly the laws which God 
has given to the lightning.&nbsp; You must make the conductor of 
metal wire, or it will be useless.&nbsp; You must make it run 
through glazed rings, or it will <!-- page 139--><a 
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>be only 
more dangerous than no conductor at all; for God who made the 
lightning chose that it should be so, and you must <i>obey</i> if
you wish to <i>conquer</i>.</p>
<p>Man could not conquer steam, and make it drive his engines and
carry his ships across the seas, till he found out and obeyed the
laws which God had given to steam; and so without breaking the 
laws, man turned them to his own use, and set the force of steam 
to turn his machines, instead of rushing idly out into the empty 
air.</p>
<p>So it is with all things, whether in heaven or earth.&nbsp; If
you want to rule, you must obey.&nbsp; If you want to rise to be 
a master, you must stoop to be a servant.&nbsp; If you want to be
master of anything in earth or heaven, you must, as that great 
Lord Verulam used to say, obey God&rsquo;s will revealed in that 
thing; and the man who will go his own way, and follow his own 
fancy, will understand nothing, and master nothing, and get 
comfort out of nothing in earth or heaven.</p>
<p>Well&mdash;when Lord Verulam told men his new wisdom, they 
laughed and scoffed, as fools always will at anything new.&nbsp; 
But one by one, wise men tried his plan, and found him right, and
went on; and from that time those who followed Lord Verulam began
discovering wonders of which they had never dreamed, and those 
who did not, but kept to the old way of witchcraft and magic, 
found out nothing, and made themselves a laughing stock.&nbsp; 
And after a while witchcraft vanished out of all civilised 
countries, and in its place came all the wonderful comforts and 
discoveries which we have now, and which under God, we owe to the
wisdom of the great Lord Verulam.&nbsp; Cotton mills, steam 
engines, railroads, electric telegraphs, sanitary reforms, cheap 
books, penny postage, good medicine and surgery, and a <!-- page 
140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
140</span>thousand blessings more.&nbsp; That great Lord 
Chancellor has been the father of them all.</p>
<p>And a noble thought it is for us Church people, and a glorious
testimony to the good training which the Church of England gives,
that the three men, who more than any others laid the foundation 
of all our wonderful discoveries, I mean Lord Verulam, Mr. Boyle,
and Sir Isaac Newton, were all of them heart and soul members of 
the Church of England.</p>
<p>I said just now that the man who will not obey, will never 
rule; that the man who will not stoop to be a servant, will never
rise to be a master; that the man who neglects God&rsquo;s will 
and mind about things, and will follow his own will and fancy, 
will understand nothing, and master nothing, and get comfort out 
of nothing, either in earth or heaven.</p>
<p>Either in earth or heaven, I say.&nbsp; For the same rule 
which holds good in this earthly world, which we do see, holds 
good in the heavenly world which we do not see.&nbsp; Solomon 
does not part the two worlds, and I cannot.&nbsp; Solomon says 
the same rules which hold good about men&rsquo;s bodies, hold 
good about their souls.&nbsp; The great Lord Verulam used always 
to say the same, and we must believe the same.&nbsp; For see, 
Solomon says, that this same wisdom by which God made the worlds,
will help our souls as well as our bodies; that it is not merely 
the earthly wisdom which brings a man length of life and riches, 
but heavenly wisdom, which is a tree of life to every one who 
lays hold of her (Prov. iii. 18).&nbsp; The heavenly wisdom which
begins in trusting in the Lord with all our heart, the heavenly 
wisdom which is learnt by chastenings and afflictions, and 
teaches us that we are the sons of God, is the very same wisdom 
by <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>which God founded the earth, and makes the clouds drop 
down dew!&nbsp; Strange at first sight; but not strange if we 
remember the Athanasian creed, and believe that God is one God, 
who has no parts or passions, and therefore cannot change or be 
divided.</p>
<p>Yes, my friends, God&rsquo;s wisdom is one&mdash;unchangeable,
everlasting, and always like itself; and by the same wisdom by 
which He made the earth and the heavens, by the same wisdom by 
which He made our bodies, has He made our souls; and therefore we
can, and are bound to, glorify Him alike in our bodies and our 
spirits, for both are His.</p>
<p>It may not seem easy to understand this; but I will explain 
what I mean by an example.&nbsp; I just told you, that in earthly
matters we must stoop to conquer; we must obey the laws which God
has given to anything, before we can master and use that 
thing.&nbsp; And in matters about our own soul&mdash;about our 
behaviour to God&mdash;about our behaviour to our fellow-men, 
believe me there is no rule like the golden one of Lord 
Verulam&rsquo;s&mdash;stoop to conquer&mdash;obey if you wish to 
rule.&nbsp; For see now.&nbsp; What is there more common than 
this?&nbsp; It happens to each of us every day.&nbsp; We meet a 
fellow-man our equal, neither better nor worse than ourselves, 
and we want to make him do something.&nbsp; Now there are two 
ways in which we may set about that.&nbsp; We may drive our man, 
or we may lead him.&nbsp; You know well enough which of those two
ways is likely to succeed best.&nbsp; If you try to drive the 
man, you say to yourself, &ldquo;I know I am right.&nbsp; I see 
the thing in this light, and he is a fool if he does not see it 
in the same light.&nbsp; I choose to have the thing done, and 
done it shall be, and if he is stupid enough not to take my <!-- 
page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
142</span>view of it, I will let him know who I am, and we will 
see which of us is the stronger!&rdquo;&nbsp; So says many a man 
in his heart.&nbsp; But what comes of it?&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; 
For the other man gets angry, and determines to have his way in 
his turn.&nbsp; There is a quarrel and a great deal of noise; and
most probably the thing is not done.&nbsp; Instead of the man 
getting what he wants, he has a fresh quarrel on his hands, and 
nothing more.&nbsp; So his blustering is no sign that he is 
really strong.&nbsp; For the strong man is the man who <i>can</i>
get what he wants done.&nbsp; Is he not?&nbsp; Surely we shall 
all agree to that.&nbsp; And the proud, hot, positive, 
dictatorial, self-willed man is just the man, in a free country 
like this, who does <i>not</i> get what he wants done.&nbsp; He 
will not stoop&mdash;therefore he will not conquer.</p>
<p>But suppose we take another plan.&nbsp; Suppose instead of 
trying to drive, we try to lead.&nbsp; Suppose if we want a man 
to do anything, we begin by obeying him, and serving him, that we
may afterwards lead him, and afterwards make use of him.&nbsp; 
There is a base, mean way of doing that, by flattering, and 
fawning, and cringing, which are certainly the devil&rsquo;s 
works.&nbsp; For the devil can put on the form of an angel of 
light; but we need not do that.&nbsp; We may serve and obey a man
honestly and honourably, in order to get him to do what he ought 
to do.&nbsp; I will tell you what I mean.</p>
<p>Suppose when we have dealings with any man, we begin with him,
as I was saying we ought to begin with earthly things&mdash;with 
a field for instance&mdash;we should say, before I begin to make 
this field bear the crop I want I must look it through and 
understand it.&nbsp; I must see what state it is in&mdash;what 
its soil is&mdash;what has been taken off it already&mdash;what 
the weather is&mdash;what state <!-- page 143--><a 
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>of drainage
it is in, and so forth; and I must obey the rules of all these 
things, or my crop will come to nothing.&nbsp; So with this 
man.&nbsp; First of all, before I get anything out of the man, I 
must understand the man.&nbsp; I must find out what sort of 
temper and character he has, what his opinions are, how he has 
been brought up, how he has been accustomed to look at 
things&mdash;so as to be able to make allowance for all, else I 
shall never be able to understand how he looks at this one 
matter, or to make him understand <i>my</i> way of looking at 
it.&nbsp; And to do that&mdash;to understand the man, or make him
understand me, I must begin by making a <i>friend</i> of him.</p>
<p>There, my friends&mdash;there is one of the blessed laws of 
the kingdom of Heaven, that in a free country (as this, thank 
God, is) the only sure way to get power and influence over 
people, is by making <i>friends</i> of them, by behaving like 
Christians to them, making them trust you and love you, by 
pleasing them, giving way to them, making yourself of service to 
them, doing what they like whenever you can, in order that they 
may do to you, as you have done to them, and measure back to you 
(as the Lord Jesus promises they will), with the same measure 
with which you have measured to them.&nbsp; In short, serving 
men, that you may rule them, and stooping before them that you 
may conquer them.</p>
<p>And if any of you are too proud to try this plan, and think it
fairer to drive men than to lead them, I can tell you of two 
persons who were not as proud as you are, and were not ashamed to
do what you are ashamed to do&mdash;and yet they are two persons,
before the least of whom you would hang your head, and feel, as I
am sure I should, a very small, and mean, and pitiful person if I
met them in the road.</p>
<p><!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>For the first, and by far the least of the two, is St. 
Paul.&nbsp; Now St. Paul says this was the very plan by which he 
got influence over men, and persuaded and converted them, and 
brought them home to God, by being himself a servant to all men, 
and pleasing all men, being a Jew to the Jews, and a Greek to the
Greeks, and all things to all men, if by any means he might save 
some.&nbsp; Giving up, giving way, taking trouble, putting 
himself out of the way, as we say here, all day long, to win 
people to love him, and trust him, and see that he really cared 
for them, and therefore to be ready to listen to him.&nbsp; From 
what one can see of St. Paul&rsquo;s manners, from his own 
Epistles, he must have been the most perfect gentleman; a gentle 
man, civil, obliging, delicate minded, careful to hurt no 
one&rsquo;s feelings; and when he had (as he had often) to say 
rough things and deal with rough men, doing it as tenderly and 
carefully as he could, like his Master the Lord Jesus Christ, 
lest he should break the bruised reed, or quench the smoking 
flax.&nbsp; Which of us can read the Epistle to Philemon (which 
to my mind is the most civil, pleasant, kindly, gentlemanlike 
speech which I know on earth), without saying to ourselves, 
&ldquo;Ah, if we had but St. Paul&rsquo;s manners, St. 
Paul&rsquo;s temper, St. Paul&rsquo;s way of managing people, how
few quarrels there would be in this noisy troublesome 
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I said that there was one greater than St. Paul who was 
not ashamed to behave in the very same way, stooping to all, 
conciliating all.&nbsp; And so there is&mdash;One whose shoes St.
Paul was not worthy to stoop down and unloose&mdash;and that is, 
the Lord Jesus Christ Himself&mdash;who ate and drank with 
publicans and sinners, who went out into the highways and hedges,
to bring home <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>into God&rsquo;s kingdom poor 
wretches whom men despised and cast off.&nbsp; It was He who 
taught St. Paul to behave in the same way.&nbsp; May He teach us 
to behave in the same way also!&nbsp; St. Paul learnt to discern 
men&rsquo;s spirits, and feel for them, and understand them, and 
help them, and comfort them, and at last to turn and change them 
whichever way he chose, simply because he was full of the Spirit 
of Christ, who is the Spirit of God, proceeding both from the 
Father and the Son.</p>
<p>For St. Paul says positively, that his reason for not pleasing
himself, but taking so much trouble to please other people, was 
because Christ also pleased not Himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;We that are
strong,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;ought to bear the infirmities of 
the weak, and not to please ourselves.&nbsp; Let every man please
his neighbour for his good unto edification, for even Christ 
pleased not Himself,&rdquo; (Rom. xv. 1-3.)&nbsp; And again, 
&ldquo;We have a High Priest who can be touched with the feeling 
of our infirmities,&rdquo; (Heb. iv. 15).&nbsp; So it was by 
stooping to men, that Christ learned to understand men, and by 
understanding men He was able to save men.&nbsp; And again, St. 
Paul says, &ldquo;Let this mind be in you which was also in 
Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, and equal with 
God,&rdquo; yet&mdash;&ldquo;made Himself of no reputation, but 
took upon Him the form of a slave, and was made in the likeness 
of man, and being found in fashion as a man, <i>humbled 
Himself</i>, and became <i>obedient unto death</i>, even the 
death of the cross,&rdquo; (Phil. ii. 5, 9, 10).</p>
<p>There, my friends&mdash;there was the perfect fulfilment of 
the great law&mdash;<i>Stoop to conquer</i>.&nbsp; There was the 
reward of Christ&rsquo;s not pleasing Himself.&nbsp; Christ 
stooped lower than any man, and therefore He rose again higher 
than all men.&nbsp; He did more to please men than any <!-- page 
146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
146</span>man; and therefore God was better pleased with Him than
with all men, and a voice came from Heaven, saying&mdash;This 
Person who stoops to the lowest depths that He may understand and
help those who were in the lowest deep&mdash;this outcast who has
not where to lay His head, slandered, blasphemed, spit on, 
scourged, crucified, because He will help all, and feel for all, 
and preach to all; &ldquo;this is my beloved Son, in whom I am 
well pleased,&rdquo; (Matt. iii. 17).&nbsp; &ldquo;The brightness
of my glory,&mdash;the express image of my person,&rdquo; (Heb. 
i. 3).</p>
<p>My friends, this may seem to you a strange sermon, which began
by talking of railroads and steamships, and ends by talking of 
the death and the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ; and you may ask
what has the end of it to do with the beginning?</p>
<p>If you want to know, recollect that I began by saying that 
there was but <i>One</i> wisdom for earth or heaven, for man and 
for God; and that is the wisdom which lies in <i>stooping to 
conquer</i>, as the Lord Jesus Christ did.&nbsp; Think over that,
and behave accordingly; and be sure, meanwhile, that whenever you
feel proud, and self-willed, and dictatorial, and inclined to 
drive men instead of leading them, and to quarrel with them, 
instead of trying to understand them and love them, and bring 
them round gently, by appealing to their reason and good feeling,
not to their fear of you&mdash;then you are going not God&rsquo;s
way, no, nor man&rsquo;s way either, but the devil&rsquo;s 
way.&nbsp; You are going, not the way by which the Lord Jesus 
Christ rose <i>to</i> Heaven, but the way by which the devil fell
<i>from</i> Heaven, as all self-willed proud men will fall.&nbsp;
Proud and self-willed men will not get done the things they want 
to be done; while the meek, those <!-- page 147--><a 
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>who are 
gentle, and tender, and try to draw men as God does with the 
cords of <i>a man</i> and the bands of <i>love</i>, will prosper 
in this world and in the next; they will see their heart&rsquo;s 
desire; they will inherit the land, and be refreshed in the 
multitude of peace.</p>
<h2><!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>XIX.&nbsp; IT IS GOOD FOR THE YOUNG 
TO REJOICE.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let
thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the 
ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know 
thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into 
judgment.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ecclesiastes</span> 
xi. 9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people fancy that in this text God forbids young people 
to enjoy themselves.&nbsp; They think that the words are spoken 
ironically, and with a sneer, as if to say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Enjoy yourself if you will.&nbsp; Go your 
own way if you wish.&nbsp; Make a fool of yourself if you are 
determined to do so.&nbsp; You will repent it at last.&nbsp; You 
will be caught at last, and punished at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, I cannot think that there would be in Scripture or in any
word of God a sneer so cruel and so unjust as that.&nbsp; For 
surely it would be unjust of God, if after giving young people 
the power to be happy, He then punished them for being happy, for
using the very powers which He had given them, obeying the very 
feelings which He had implanted in them, enjoying the very 
pleasures which He had put in their way.&nbsp; God cannot be a 
tempter, my friends.&nbsp; He does not surely send us into a 
world full of traps and snares, and then punish us for being 
caught in the very snares which He had set.&nbsp; God 
forbid.&nbsp; Let us never fancy such things of God the heavenly 
Father, from whom comes every good and perfect gift.&nbsp; Let us
leave such fancies for soured and <!-- page 149--><a 
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
149</span>hard-hearted persons, who make a god in their own 
likeness&mdash;a god of darkness and not of light&mdash;a grudger
and not a giver.&nbsp; And let us take this text literally and 
plainly as it stands, and see whether we cannot learn from it a 
really wholesome lesson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rejoice! oh, young man, in thy youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bible tells you to rejoice, therefore do so without 
fear.&nbsp; God has given you health, strength, spirits, hope, 
the power of enjoyment.&nbsp; And why, save but that you may 
enjoy them, and rejoice in your youth?&nbsp; He has given you 
<i>more</i> health, <i>more</i> strength, more <i>spirits</i>, 
than you need to earn your daily bread, or to learn your daily 
task.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; To enable you to <i>grow</i> in body 
and in soul.&nbsp; And that you will only do if you are 
happy.&nbsp; The human soul, says a wise man, is like a plant, 
and requires <i>sunshine</i> to make it grow and ripen.&nbsp; And
the heavenly Father has given you sunshine in your hearts that 
you may grow into hearty, healthy-minded men.&nbsp; If young 
people have not sunshine enough, if they are kept down and 
crushed in youth by sorrow, by anxiety, by fear, by over-hard 
work, by too much study, by strict and cruel masters, by dark and
superstitious notions about God&rsquo;s anger, by 
over-scrupulousness about this and that thing being sinful, then 
their souls and minds do not grow; they become more or less 
stunted, unhealthy, unhappy, slavish, and mean people in 
after-life, because they have not rejoiced in their youth as God 
intended them to do.</p>
<p>Remember this, you parents, and be sure that all harshness and
cruelty to your children, all terrifying of them, all 
over-working of them, body or mind, all making them unhappy by 
requiring of them more than the plain law of God requires; or by 
teaching them to <!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>dread, not to love, their Father in 
heaven&mdash;All these will stunt and hurt their characters in 
after-life; and all are, therefore, sins against their heavenly 
Father, who willeth not that one little one should perish, and 
who will require a strict account of each of us how we have 
brought up the children whom He has committed to our 
charge.&nbsp; Let their hearts cheer them in the days of their 
youth.&nbsp; They will have trouble enough, anxiety enough 
hereafter.&nbsp; Do not you forestall the evil days for 
them.&nbsp; The more cheerful their growth is the more heart and 
spirit they will have to face the trials and sorrows of life when
they come.</p>
<p>But further, the text says to the young man, Walk in the ways 
of thy heart.&nbsp; That is God&rsquo;s permission to free men, 
in a free country.&nbsp; You are not slaves either to man or to 
God; and God does not treat you as slaves, but as children whom 
He can trust.&nbsp; He says, Walk in the ways of thine own 
heart.&nbsp; Do what you will, provided it be not wrong.&nbsp; 
Choose your own path in life.&nbsp; Exert yourselves boldly to 
better yourselves in any path you choose, which is not a path of 
dishonesty and sin.</p>
<p>Again, says the text, Walk in the sight of thine eyes.&nbsp; 
As your bodies are free, let your minds be free likewise.&nbsp; 
See for yourselves, judge for yourselves.&nbsp; God has given you
eyes, brains, understanding; use them.&nbsp; Get knowledge for 
yourselves, get experience for yourselves.&nbsp; Educate and 
cultivate your own minds.&nbsp; Live, as far as you can, a free, 
reasonable, cheerful, happy life, enjoying this world, if you 
feel able to enjoy it.&nbsp; But know thou, that for all these 
things, God will bring thee into judgment.</p>
<p>Ah! say some, there is the sting.&nbsp; How can we <!-- page 
151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
151</span>enjoy ourselves if we are to be brought into judgment 
after all?</p>
<p>My friends, before I answer that question, let me ask 
one.&nbsp; Do you look on God as a taskmaster, requiring of you, 
as the Egyptians did of the Jews, to make bricks all day without 
straw, and noting down secretly every moment that you take your 
eyes off your work, that He may punish you for it years hence 
when you have forgotten it&mdash;extreme to mark what is done 
amiss?</p>
<p>Or do you look on God as a Father who rejoices in the 
happiness of His children?&mdash;Who sets them no work to do but 
what is good for them, and requires them to do nothing without 
giving them first the power and the means to do it?&mdash;A 
Father who knows our necessities before we ask for help and a 
Saviour who is able and willing to give us help?&nbsp; If you 
think of God in that former way as a stern taskmaster, I can tell
you nothing about Him.&nbsp; I know Him not; I find Him neither 
in the Bible, in the world, nor in my own conscience and 
reason.&nbsp; He is not the God of the Bible, the God of the 
Gospel whom I am commanded to preach to you.</p>
<p>But if you think of God as a Father, as your Father in heaven,
who chastens you in His love that you may partake of His 
holiness, and of His Son Jesus Christ as your Saviour, your Lord,
who loves you, and desires your salvation, body and soul&mdash;of
Him I can speak; for He is the True and only God, revealed by His
Son Jesus Christ our Lord; and in His light I can tell you to 
rejoice and take comfort, ever though He brings you into 
judgment; for being your Father in heaven, He can mean nothing 
but your good, and He would not bring you into judgment if that 
too was not good for you.</p>
<p><!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>Now, you must remember that the judgment of which 
Solomon speaks here is a judgment in <i>this</i> life.&nbsp; The 
whole Book of Ecclesiastes, from which the text is taken, is 
about <i>this</i> life.&nbsp; Solomon says so specially, and 
carefully.&nbsp; He is giving here advice to his son; and his 
doctrine all through is, that a man&rsquo;s happiness or misery 
in <i>this</i> life, his good or bad fortune in <i>this</i> life,
depend almost entirely on his own conduct; and, above all, on his
conduct in youth.&nbsp; As a man sows he shall reap, is his 
doctrine.</p>
<p>Therefore, he says, in this very chapter, Do what if right, 
just because it is right.&nbsp; It is sure to pay you in the long
run, somehow, somewhere, somewhen.&nbsp; Cast thy bread on the 
waters&mdash;that is, do a generous thing whenever you have an 
opportunity&mdash;and thou shalt find it after many days.&nbsp; 
Give a portion to seven, and also to eight, for thou knowest not 
what evil shall be on the earth.&nbsp; Every action of yours will
bear fruit.&nbsp; Every thing you do, and every word you say, 
will God bring into judgment, sooner or later.&nbsp; It will rise
up against you, years afterwards, to punish you, or it will rise 
up for you, years afterwards, to reward you.&nbsp; It must be so,
says Solomon; that is the necessary, eternal, moral law of 
God&rsquo;s world.&nbsp; As you do, so will you be 
rewarded.&nbsp; If the clouds be full of rain, they must empty 
themselves on the earth.&nbsp; Where the tree falls, there it 
will lie.&nbsp; As we say in England, as you make your bed, so 
you will lie on it.&nbsp; That does not (as people are too apt to
think) speak of what is to happen to us after we die.&nbsp; It 
speaks expressly and only of what will happen before we 
die.&nbsp; It is the same as our English proverb.</p>
<p>Therefore, he says, do not look too far forward.&nbsp; Do not 
be double-minded, doing things with a mean and <!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>interested 
after-thought, plotting, planning, asking, will this right thing 
pay me or not?&nbsp; He that observeth the wind, and is too 
curious and anxious about the weather, will not sow; and he that 
regardeth the clouds shall not reap.&nbsp; No; just do the right 
thing which lies nearest you, and trust to God to prosper 
it.&nbsp; In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening 
withhold not thine hand; for thou knowest not which shall 
prosper, this or that, or whether they shall both be alike 
good.&nbsp; Thou knowest not, he says, the works of God, who 
maketh all.&nbsp; All thou knowest is, that the one only chance 
of success in life is to fear God and keep His commandments, for 
this is the whole duty of man.&nbsp; For God shall bring every 
work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, 
or whether it be evil.</p>
<p>Whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</p>
<p>He does not say only that God will bring your evil deeds into 
judgment.&nbsp; But that He will bring your good ones also, and 
your happiness and good fortune in this life will be, on the 
whole, made up of the sum-total of the good and harm you have 
done, of the wisdom or the folly which you have thought and 
carried out.&nbsp; It <i>is</i> so.&nbsp; You know it is 
so.&nbsp; When you look round on other men, you see that on the 
whole men prosper very much as they deserve.&nbsp; There are 
exceptions, I know.&nbsp; Solomon knew that well.&nbsp; Such 
strange and frightful exceptions, that one must believe that 
those who have been so much wronged in this life will be righted 
in the life to come.&nbsp; Children suffer for the sins of their 
parents.&nbsp; Innocent people suffer with the guilty.&nbsp; But 
these are the exceptions, not the rule.&nbsp; And these 
exceptions are much more rare than we choose to confess.&nbsp; 
When a man complains to you that <!-- page 154--><a 
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>he has been
unfortunate, that the world has been unjust to him, that he has 
not had fair play in life, and so forth, in three cases out of 
four you will find that it is more or less the man&rsquo;s own 
fault; that he has <i>deserved</i> his losses, that is, earned 
them for himself.&nbsp; I do not mean that the man need have been
a wicked man&mdash;not in the least.&nbsp; But he has been 
imprudent, perhaps weak, hasty, stupid, or something else; and 
his faults, perhaps some one fault, has hampered him, thrown him 
back, and God has brought him to judgment for it, and made it 
punish him.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Surely that he may see his fault
and repent of it, and mend it for the time to come.</p>
<p>I say, God may bring a man&rsquo;s fault into judgment, and 
let it punish him, without the man being a bad man.&nbsp; And 
you, young people, will find in after-life that you will have 
earned, deserved, merited, and worked out for yourselves a great 
deal of your own happiness and misery.</p>
<p>I know this seems a hard doctrine.&nbsp; People are always 
ready to lay their misfortunes on God, on the world, on any and 
every one, rather than on themselves.</p>
<p>A bad education, for instance&mdash;a weakly constitution 
which some bring into the world, with or without any fault of 
their own, are terrible drawbacks and sore afflictions.&nbsp; The
death of those near and dear to us, of which we cannot always 
say, I have earned this, I have brought it on myself.&nbsp; It is
the Lord.&nbsp; Let Him do what seemeth Him good.</p>
<p>But because misfortunes may come upon us without our own 
fault, that is no reason why we should not provide against the 
misfortunes which will be our own fault.&nbsp; Nay, is it not all
the stronger reason for providing <!-- page 155--><a 
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>against 
them, that there are other sorrows against which we cannot 
provide?&nbsp; Alas! is there not misery horrible enough hanging 
over our heads daily in this mortal life without our making more 
for ourselves by our own folly?&nbsp; We shall have grief enough 
before we die without adding to that grief the far bitterer 
torment of remorse!</p>
<p>Oh, young people, young people, listen to what I say!&nbsp; 
You can be, you will be, you must be, the builders of your own 
good or bad fortunes.&nbsp; On <i>you</i> it depends whether your
lives shall be honourable and happy, or dishonourable and 
sad.&nbsp; There is no such thing as luck or fortune in this 
world.&nbsp; What is called Fortune is nothing else than the 
orderly and loving providence of the Lord Jesus Christ, who 
orders all things in heaven and earth, and who will, sooner or 
later, reward every man according to his works.&nbsp; Just in 
proportion as you do the will of your Father in heaven, just so 
far will doing His will bring its own blessing and its own 
reward.</p>
<p>Instead of hoping for good fortune which may never come, or 
fearing bad fortune which may never come either, pray, each of 
you, for the Holy Spirit of God, the Spirit of right-doing, which
<i>is</i> good fortune in itself; good fortune in this world; and
in the world to come, everlasting life.&nbsp; Fear God and keep 
His commandments, and all will be well.&nbsp; For who is the man 
who is master of his own luck?&nbsp; The Psalmist tells us, in 
Psalm xv., &ldquo;He that leadeth an uncorrupt life, and doeth 
the thing which is right, and speaketh the truth from his 
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He that backbiteth not with his 
tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach
against his neighbour.&nbsp; In whose eyes a vile person is 
contemned; but he honoureth them that fear <!-- page 156--><a 
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>the Lord: 
he that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.&nbsp; He that
putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the
innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whoso doeth these things shall <i>never fall</i>.&nbsp; And as
long as you are doing those things, you may rejoice freely and 
heartily in your youth, believing that the smile of God, who gave
you the power of being happy, is on your happiness; and that your
heavenly Father no more grudges harmless pleasure to you, than He
grudges it to the gnat which dances in the sunbeam, or the bird 
which sings upon the bough.&nbsp; For He is The Father,&mdash;and
what greater delight to a father than to see his children happy, 
if only, while they are happy, they are <i>good</i>?</p>

WORLD.&mdash;A SPRING SERMON.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bless the Lord, O my soul.&nbsp; O Lord my 
God, thou art very great: thou art clothed with honour and 
majesty.&nbsp; Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment:
who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: who layeth the 
beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his 
chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind.&rdquo;&mdash;Ps.
civ. 1-3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this delicious season of the year, when spring time is fast
ripening into summer, and every hedge, and field, and garden is 
full of life and growth, full of beauty and fruitfulness; and we 
look back on the long winter, and the boughs which stood bare so 
drearily for six months, as if in a dream; the blessed spring 
with its green leaves, and gay flowers, and bright suns has put 
the winter&rsquo;s frosts out of our thoughts, and we seem to 
take instinctively to the warmth, as if it were our natural 
element&mdash;as if we were intended, like the bees and 
butterflies, to live and work only in the summer days, and not to
pass, as we do in this climate, one-third of the year, one-third 
of our whole lives, in mist, cold, and gloom.&nbsp; Now, there is
a meaning in all this&mdash;in our love of bright, warm weather, 
a very deep and blessed meaning in it.&nbsp; It is a sign to us 
where we come from&mdash;where God would have us go.&nbsp; A sign
that we came from God&rsquo;s heaven of light and beauty, that 
God&rsquo;s heaven of light and beauty is meant for us 
hereafter.&nbsp; That love which we have for spring, is <!-- page
158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>a 
sign, that we are children of the everlasting Spring, children of
the light and of the day, in body and in soul; if we would but 
claim our birthright!</p>
<p>For you must remember that mankind came from a warm 
country&mdash;a country all of sunshine and joy.&nbsp; Adam in 
the garden of Eden was in no cold or severe climate, he had no 
need of clothes, not even of the trouble of tilling the 
ground.&nbsp; The bountiful earth gave him all he wanted.&nbsp; 
The trees over his head stretched out the luscious fruits to 
him&mdash;the shady glades were his only house, the mossy banks 
his only bed.&nbsp; He was bred up the child of sunshine and 
joy.&nbsp; But he was not meant to stay there.&nbsp; God who 
brings good out of evil, gave man a real blessing when He drove 
him out of the garden of Eden.&nbsp; Men were meant to fill the 
earth and to conquer it, as they are doing at this day.&nbsp; 
They were meant to become hardy and industrious&mdash;to be 
forced to use their hands and their heads to the utmost stretch, 
to call out into practice all the powers which lay ready in 
them.&nbsp; They were meant, in short, according to the great law
of God&rsquo;s world, to be made perfect through sufferings, and 
therefore it was God&rsquo;s kindness, and not cruelty, to our 
forefathers, when He sent them out into the world; and that He 
did not send them into any exceedingly hot country, where they 
would have become utterly lazy and profligate, like the negroes 
and the South Sea islanders, who have no need to work, because 
the perpetual summer gives them their bread ready-made to their 
hands.&nbsp; And it was a kindness, too, that God did not send 
our forefathers out into any exceedingly cold country, like the 
Greenlanders and the Esquimaux, where the perpetual winter would 
have made them greedy, and stunted, and stupid; but that He sent 
us <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>into this temperate climate, where there is a continual
change and variety of seasons.&nbsp; Here first, stern and 
wholesome winter, then bright, cheerful summer, each bringing a 
message and a lesson from our loving Father in heaven.&nbsp; 
First comes winter, to make us hardy and daring, and industrious,
and strips the trees, and bares the fields, and takes away all 
food from the earth, and cries to us with the voice of its 
storms, &ldquo;He that will <i>not work</i>, neither shall he 
eat.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider 
her ways, and be wise: who layeth up her meat in the summer, and 
provideth her food against the time of frosts.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
then comes summer, with her flowers and her fruits, and brings us
her message from God, and says to us poor, slaving, hard-worn 
children of men, &ldquo;You are not meant to freeze, and toil, 
and ache for ever.&nbsp; God loves to see you happy; God is 
willing to feed your eyes with fair sights, your bodies with 
pleasant food, to cheer your hearts with warmth and sunshine as 
much as is good for you.&nbsp; He does not grieve willingly, nor 
afflict the children of men.&nbsp; See the very bees and gnats, 
how they dance and bask in the sunbeams!&nbsp; See the very 
sparrows, how they choose their mates and build their nests, and 
enjoy themselves as if they were children of the spring!&nbsp; 
And are not ye of more value than many sparrows? you who can 
understand and enjoy the spring, you men and women who can 
understand and enjoy God&rsquo;s fair earth ten thousand times 
more than those dumb creatures can.&nbsp; It is for <i>you</i> 
God has made the spring.&nbsp; It is for <i>your</i> sakes that 
Christ, the ruler of the earth, sends light and fruitfulness, and
beauty over the world year by year.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Not 
merely to warm and feed your bodies, but to stir up your hearts 
with grateful love to Him, the <!-- page 160--><a 
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>Blessed 
One, and to teach you what you are to expect from Him 
hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ay, my friends, this is the message the spring and summer 
bring with them&mdash;they are signs and sacraments from God, 
earnests of the everlasting spring&mdash;the world of unfading 
beauty and perpetual happiness which is the proper home of man, 
which God has prepared for those that love Him&mdash;the world 
wherein there shall be no more curse, neither sorrow nor sighing,
but the Lord God and the Lamb shall be the light thereof; and the
rivers of that world shall be waters of life, and the trees of 
that world shall be for the healing of the nations; and the 
children of the Lord God shall see Him face to face, and be kings
and priests to Him for ever and ever.&nbsp; Therefore, I say, 
rejoice in spring time, and in the sights, and sounds, and scents
which spring time, as a rule, brings; and remember, once for all,
never lose an opportunity of seeing anything beautiful.&nbsp; 
Beauty is God&rsquo;s hand-writing&mdash;God&rsquo;s image.&nbsp;
It is a wayside sacrament, a cup of blessing; welcome it in every
fair landscape, every fair face, every fair flower, and drink it 
in with all your eyes, and thank Christ for it, who is Himself 
the well-spring of all beauty, who giveth all things richly to 
enjoy.</p>
<p>I think, this 104th Psalm is a fit and proper psalm to preach 
on in this sweet spring time; for it speaks, from beginning to 
end, of God&rsquo;s earth, and of His glory, and love, and wisdom
which shines forth on this earth.&nbsp; And though, at first 
sight, it may not seem to have much to do with Christianity, and 
with the great mystery of our redemption, yet, I believe and know
that it has at bottom all and everything to do with it; that this
104th Psalm is as full of comfort and <!-- page 161--><a 
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>instruction
for Christian men as any other Psalm in the whole Bible.&nbsp; I 
believe that without feeling rightly and healthily about this 
Psalm, we shall not feel rightly or healthily about any other 
part of the Bible, either Old or New Testament.&nbsp; At all 
events God&rsquo;s inspired psalmist was not ashamed to write 
this psalm.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s Spirit thought it worth while to 
teach him to write this psalm.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s providence 
thought it worth while to preserve this psalm for us in His holy 
Bible, and therefore I think it must be worth while for <i>us</i>
to understand this psalm, unless we pretend to be wiser than 
God.&nbsp; I have no fancy for picking and choosing out of the 
holy Bible; <i>all</i> Scripture is given by inspiration of 
God&mdash;all Scripture is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, 
for correction, for instruction in righteousness, and therefore 
this 104th Psalm is profitable as well as the rest; and 
especially profitable to be explained in a few sermons as I said 
before, at <i>this</i> season when, if we have any eyes to see 
with, or hearts to feel with, we ought to be wondering at and 
admiring God&rsquo;s glorious earth, and saying, with the old 
prophet in my text, &ldquo;Praise the Lord, O my soul.&nbsp; O 
Lord my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour 
and majesty.&nbsp; Who coverest thyself with light as with a 
garment: who stretchest out the heavens as with a curtain: who 
layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the 
clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind . . . 
O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them
all: the earth is full of thy riches&rdquo; (Ps. civ. 1, 2, 3, 
24).</p>
<p>First, then, consider those wonderful words of the text, how 
God covers Himself with light as it were with a garment.&nbsp; 
Truly there is something most divine in <!-- page 162--><a 
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>light; it 
seems an especial pattern and likeness of God.&nbsp; The Bible 
uses it so continually.&nbsp; Light is a pattern of God&rsquo;s 
wisdom; for light sees into everything, searches through 
everything, and light is a pattern of God&rsquo;s revelation, for
light shows us everything; without light our eyes would be 
useless&mdash;and so without God our soul&rsquo;s eyes would be 
useless.&nbsp; It is God who teaches us all we know.&nbsp; It is 
God who makes us understand all we understand.&nbsp; He opens the
meaning of everything to us, just as the light shews everything 
to us; and as in the sunlight only we see the brightness and 
beauty of the earth, so it is written, &ldquo;In thy light, O 
God, we shall see light.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus light is God&rsquo;s 
garment.&nbsp; It shows Him to us, and yet it hides Him from 
us.&nbsp; Who could dare or bear to look on God if we saw Him as 
He is face to face?&nbsp; Our souls would be dazzled blind, as 
our eyes are by the sun at noonday.&nbsp; But now, light is a 
pattern to us of God&rsquo;s glory; and therefore it is written, 
that light <i>is</i> God&rsquo;s garment, that God dwells in the 
light which no man can approach unto.&nbsp; As a wise old heathen
nobly said, &ldquo;Light is the shadow of God;&rdquo; and so, as 
the text says, He stretches out those glorious blue heavens above
us as a curtain and shield, to hide our eyes from His unutterable
splendour, and yet to lift our souls up to Him.&nbsp; The 
vastness and the beauty of those heavens, with all their 
countless stars, each one a sun or a world in itself, should 
teach us how small we are, how great is our Father who made all 
these.</p>
<p>When we see a curtain, and know that it bides something 
beautiful behind it, our curiosity and wonder is awakened, and we
long all the more to see what is behind that curtain.&nbsp; So 
the glory of those skies ought <!-- page 163--><a 
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>to make us 
wonder and long all the more to see the God who made the 
skies.</p>
<p>But again, the Psalmist says that God lays the beams of His 
chambers in the waters, and makes the clouds His chariot, and 
walks upon the wings of the wind! that He makes His angels the 
storms, and His ministers a flaming fire.&nbsp; You must not 
suppose that the psalmist had such a poor notion of the great 
infinite God, as to fancy that He could be in any one 
<i>place</i>.&nbsp; God wants no chambers&mdash;even though they 
were built of the clouds, arched with rainbows, as wide as the 
whole vault of heaven.&nbsp; He wants no wind to carry 
Him&mdash;He carries all things and moves all things.&nbsp; In 
Him they live, and move, and have their being.&nbsp; Yet 
Him&mdash;the heaven, and the heaven of heavens cannot contain 
Him!&nbsp; He is everywhere and no <i>where</i>&mdash;for He is a
Spirit; He is in all things, and yet He is no 
<i>thing</i>&mdash;for He was before all things, and in Him all 
things consist.&nbsp; He is the Absolute, the Uncreated, the 
Infinite, the One and the All.&nbsp; And the old Psalmist knew 
that as well as we do, perhaps better.&nbsp; What, then, did he 
mean by these two last verses?&nbsp; He meant, that in all those 
things God was present&mdash;that the world was not like a 
machine, a watch, which God had wound up at the creation, and 
started off to go of itself; but that His Spirit, His providence,
were guiding everything, even as at the first.&nbsp; That those 
mists and rain came from Him, and went where He sent them; that 
those clouds carried <i>His</i> blessings to mankind; that when 
the thunder shower bursts on one parish, and leaves the next one 
dry, it is because God will have it so; that He brings the 
blessed purifying winds out of His treasures, to sweeten and 
fatten the earth with the fresh breath of life, which <!-- page 
164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
164</span>they have drunk up from the great Atlantic seas, and 
from the rich forests of America&mdash;that they blow whither He 
thinks best; that clouds and rain, wind and lightning, are His 
fruitful messengers and His wholesome ministers, fulfilling His 
word, each according to their own laws, but also each according 
to His especial providence, who has given the whole earth to the 
children of men.&nbsp; This is the meaning of the Psalmist, that 
the weather is not a dead machine, but a living, wonderful work 
of the Spirit of God, the Lord and giver of life.&nbsp; Therefore
we may dare to pray for fair and seasonable weather; we may dare 
to pray against blight and tempest&mdash;humbly, because we know 
not what is altogether good for us,&mdash;but boldly and freely, 
because we know that there is a living, loving God, governing the
weather, who does know what is good for us; who has given us His 
only begotten Son, and will with Him also give us all things.</p>
<p>And so ends my first sermon on the 104th Psalm.</p>
<h2><!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>XXI.&nbsp; WONDERS OF THE SEA; OR 
DAILY MIRACLES.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou coverest the earth with the deep sea 
as with a garment.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm</span> 
civ. 6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we look at a map of the world, one of the first things 
that strikes us as curious is, how little dry land there is, and 
how much sea.&nbsp; More than half the world covered with deep, 
wild, raging, waste salt water!&nbsp; It seems very 
strange.&nbsp; Of what use to man can all that sea be?&nbsp; And 
yet the Scripture says that the whole earth has God given to the 
children of men.&nbsp; And therefore He has given to us the sea 
which is part of the earth.&nbsp; But of what use is the sea to 
us?</p>
<p>We are ready to say at first sight, &ldquo;How much better if 
the world had been all dry land?&nbsp; There would have been so 
much more space for men to spread on&mdash;so much more land to 
grow corn on.&nbsp; What is the use of all that sea?&rdquo;&nbsp;
But when we look into the matter, we shall find, that every word 
of God stands true, in every jot and tittle of it&mdash;that we 
ought to thank God for the sea as much as for the land&mdash;that
David spoke truly when he said, in this Psalm civ., that the 
great and wide sea also is full of God&rsquo;s riches.</p>
<p>For in the first place&mdash;What should we do without 
water?&nbsp; Not only to drink, but to feed all trees, and crops 
which grow.&nbsp; Those who live in a dry parish <!-- page 
166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
166</span>know well the need of water for the crops.&nbsp; In 
fact, strange as it may seem, out of water is made wood.&nbsp; 
You know, perhaps, that plants are made out of the salts in the 
soil&mdash;but not only out of salts&mdash;they are made also out
of water.&nbsp; Every leaf and flower is made up only of those 
two things&mdash;salts from the soil, and water from the 
sky.&nbsp; Most wonderful!&nbsp; But so it is.&nbsp; Water is 
made up of several very different things.&nbsp; The leaves and 
flowers, when they drink up water, keep certain parts of water, 
and turn them into wood; and the part of the water which 
<i>they</i> do not want, is just the part which <i>we</i> do 
want, namely, fresh air, for water is full of fresh air.&nbsp; 
And therefore the plants breathe out the fresh air through their 
leaves, that we may breathe it into our lungs.&nbsp; More and 
more wonders, you see, as we go on!</p>
<p>But where does all the rain water and spring water come 
from?&nbsp; From the clouds.&nbsp; And where do the clouds come 
from?&nbsp; From the <i>Sea</i>.&nbsp; The sea water is drawn up 
by the sun&rsquo;s heat, evaporated, as we call it, into the air,
and makes mist, and that mist grows together into clouds.&nbsp; 
And these clouds empty their blessed life-giving treasures on the
land&mdash;to feed man, and beast, and herb.</p>
<p>But what is it which governs these clouds, and makes them do 
their appointed work?&nbsp; The Psalmist tells us, &ldquo;At Thy 
rebuke they flee; at the voice of Thy thunder they are 
afraid.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gives the same account of it which wise 
men now-a-days give.&nbsp; It is God, he says, and the Providence
of God, which raises the clouds, and makes them water the 
earth.&nbsp; And the means which He employs is thunder.&nbsp; Now
this is strictly true.&nbsp; We all know that thunder gathers the
clouds together, and brings <!-- page 167--><a 
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>rain: but 
we do not all know that the power which makes the thunder, which 
we call electricity, is working all around us everywhere.&nbsp; 
It is only when it bursts out, in flame and noise, which we call 
lightning and thunder, that we perceive it&mdash;but it is still 
there, this wonderful thing called electricity, for ever at 
work&mdash;giving the clouds their shape, making them fly with 
vast weights of water through the sky, and then making them pour 
down that water in rain.</p>
<p>But there is another deep meaning in those words of the 
Psalmist&rsquo;s about thunder.&nbsp; He tells us that at the 
voice of God&rsquo;s thunder the waters are afraid&mdash;that He 
has set them their bounds which they shall not pass, nor turn 
again to cover the earth.&nbsp; And it is true.&nbsp; Also that 
it is this same thunder power which makes dry land&mdash;for 
there is thunder beneath us, and lightning too, in the bowels of 
the earth.&nbsp; Those who live near burning mountains know this 
well.&nbsp; They see not only flames, but <i>real</i> lightning, 
<i>real</i> thunder playing about the burning mouths of the fiery
mountains&mdash;they hear the roaring, the thundering of the 
fire-kingdom miles beneath their feet, under the solid crust of 
the earth.&nbsp; And they see, too, whole hills, ay, whole 
counties, sometimes, heaved up many feet in a single night, by 
this thunder under ground&mdash;and islands thrown up in the 
midst of the sea&mdash;so that where there was once deep water is
now dry land.</p>
<p>Now, in this very way, strange as it may seem, almost all dry 
land is made.&nbsp; This whole country of England once lay at the
bottom of the sea.&nbsp; You may now see shells and sea fishes 
bedded in high rocks and hill tops.&nbsp; But it was all heaved 
up by the thunder which works under ground.&nbsp; There are 
places in England where I <!-- page 168--><a 
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>have seen 
the marks of the fire on the rocks; and the solid stone crushed, 
and twisted, and melted by the vast force of the fire which 
thrust up the land from beneath&mdash;and thus the land was 
heaved up from under the waters, and the sea fled away and left 
its old bed dry&mdash;firm land and high cliffs&mdash;and as the 
Psalmist says, &ldquo;At the voice of God&rsquo;s thunder the 
waters were afraid.&nbsp; Thou hast set them their bounds which 
they shall not pass, neither turn again to cover the 
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wonderful as all this may seem, all learned men know that it 
is true.&nbsp; And this one thing at least it ought to teach us, 
what a wonderful and Almighty God we have to deal with, whose 
hand made all these things&mdash;and what a loving and merciful 
God, who makes not only the wind and the sea, and the thunder and
the fire kingdoms obey Him, but makes their violence bring 
blessings to mankind.&nbsp; The fire kingdom heaves up dry land 
for men to dwell on&mdash;the thunder brings mellow 
rains&mdash;the winds sweep the air clean, and freshen all our 
breath&mdash;and feed the plants with rich air drawn from far 
forests in America, and from the wild raging seas&mdash;the sea 
sends up its continual treasures of rain&mdash;everywhere are 
harmony and fitness, beauty and use in all God&rsquo;s 
works.&nbsp; He has made nothing in vain.&nbsp; All His works 
praise Him, and surely, also, His saints should give thanks to 
Him!&nbsp; Oh! my friends&mdash;every thunder shower&mdash;every 
fresh south-west breeze, is a miracle of God&rsquo;s mercy, if we
could but see thoroughly into it.</p>
<p>Consider, again, another wonderful proof of God&rsquo;s 
goodness in what we call the Tides of the sea.&nbsp; God has made
the waters so, that they can never stand still&mdash;the sea is 
always moving.&nbsp; Twice a day it rises, and twice a day it 
sinks and ebbs again all along the shore.&nbsp; It <!-- page 
169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
169</span>would take too long to explain why this is&mdash;but it
is enough to say, that it must be so, from the way in which God 
has made the earth and the water.&nbsp; So that it did not come 
from accident.&nbsp; God planned and intended it all when He made
the sea at first.&nbsp; His all-foreseeing love settled it 
all.&nbsp; Now of what use are these tides?&nbsp; They keep the 
sea from rotting, by keeping it in a perpetual stir.&nbsp; And 
the sea, as it ebbs and flows, draws the air after it, and so 
keeps the air continually moving and blowing, therefore 
continually fresh, and continually carrying in it rich food for 
plants from one country to another.&nbsp; There are other reasons
why the winds blow, which I have not time to mention now; but 
they all go to prove the same thing.&mdash;How wisely and well 
the Psalmist said, &ldquo;Praise the Lord upon earth ye rivers 
and all deeps.&nbsp; Fire and hail, snow and vapour, wind and 
storm, fulfilling His word&rdquo; (Ps. cxlviii.).</p>
<p>Another use of the sea, again, is the vast quantity of food 
which it gives.&nbsp; Labouring men who live inland have no 
notion of the wonderful fruitfulness of those seemingly barren 
wastes of water, or how many millions of human beings live mostly
on fish.&nbsp; When we consider those great banks of 
Newfoundland, where fish enough perhaps to feed all England are 
caught every season, and sent over the whole world; our own 
herring fisheries, where thousands of millions of fish are caught
yearly&mdash;and all the treasures of food and the creeping 
things innumerable, both small and great beasts, of which the 
Psalmist speaks; when we consider all this, we shall begin to 
bless God for the sea, as much as for the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There go the ships,&rdquo; too, says the Psalmist, in 
this <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>104th Psalm, &ldquo;and there goeth 
that leviathan, whom Thou hast made to take his pastime 
therein.&rdquo;&nbsp; This leviathan is no doubt the 
whale&mdash;the largest of all living things&mdash;often a 
hundred feet long, and as thick as a house.&nbsp; And yet even of
him, the monster of all monsters, does God&rsquo;s Word stand 
true, that He has put all things under man&rsquo;s feet, that all
things are in subjection to man&mdash;the fish of the sea, and 
whatsoever walketh through the paths of the sea.&nbsp; For even 
the great whale cannot stand before the cunning of man&mdash;God 
has taught man the means of killing even it, and turning it to 
his own use.&nbsp; The whalebone which we use, the oil which we 
burn in lamps, comes from the bodies of those enormous creatures 
which wander in the far seas like floating houses, ten thousand 
miles away.</p>
<p>But again, it is promised in the Bible, that in the new 
heavens and new earth there shall be no more sea.&nbsp; When the 
sea has done its work, God will have done with it&mdash;and then 
there will be no more division between nation and nation&mdash;no
more long dangerous voyages from one country to another.</p>
<p>And strange to say&mdash;the sea is even now at work bringing 
about this very thing&mdash;destroying itself&mdash;filling 
itself up.&nbsp; Day by day the sea eats away its own shore, and 
banks, and carries down their remains to make its own bed 
shallower and shallower, till shoals and new lands arise where 
there was deep sea before.&nbsp; So that if the world lasts long 
enough, the sea by its own laws will be filled up, and dry land 
appear everywhere.</p>
<p>The bottom of the sea is full, too, of countless millions of 
strange insects&mdash;and yet even in these strange insects there
is use; for not only do they give food to countless millions of 
fishes, but after a time they turn into stone, <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>and form 
fruitful soil.&nbsp; There are now in many parts of the world 
great beds of rock and earth, many feet thick, and miles long, 
made up entirely out of the skeletons and shells of little 
insects which lived at the bottom of the sea thousands of years 
ago.</p>
<p>Are not these things wonderful?&nbsp; Well, then, remember who
made these wonders? who keeps them working?&nbsp; Your 
Father&mdash;and the Son of God, and the Spirit of God.&nbsp; The
Son of God&mdash;ay, think of Him&mdash;He by whom all things 
were made&mdash;He by whom all things consist&mdash;He to whom 
all power is given in heaven and earth.&nbsp; He came down and 
died on the cross for you.&nbsp; He calls to you to come and 
serve Him loyally and gratefully&mdash;dare you refuse 
Him&mdash;The Maker and King of this glorious world?&nbsp; He 
died for you.&nbsp; He loves you.&nbsp; He condescends to beseech
you to come to Him that you may have life.&nbsp; Alas! what can 
you expect if you will not come to Him?&nbsp; How will you escape
if you turn your back on your Maker, and despise your own Creator
when He stoops to entreat you?&nbsp; Oh folly&mdash;Oh 
madness&mdash;Oh utter shame and ruin!</p>
<p>There are some people who do not like science and philosophy, 
because they say, If you try to explain to people, and make them 
understand the wonderful things around them, they will stop 
thinking them wonderful, and so you will spoil their reverence, 
and &ldquo;familiarity will breed contempt.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, no 
doubt a little learning is a dangerous thing, when it makes some 
shallow conceited fellow fancy he knows all about 
everything.&nbsp; But I can truly say, that the more you really 
do know about this earth, the more your astonishment at it will 
grow&mdash;for the <i>more</i> you understand about trees and 
animals, clouds and seas, the <i>less</i> you will find you 
understand <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>about them.&nbsp; The more you read 
about them and watch them, the more infinitely and inexpressibly 
wonderful you find them, and the more you get humbled and 
awestruck at the boundless wisdom and love of Our Father in 
Heaven, and Christ the Word of God who planned and made this 
wondrous world, and the Holy Spirit of God who is working this 
wondrous world.&nbsp; I tell you, my friends, that as St. Paul 
says, &ldquo;If a man will be wise, let him become a fool that he
may be wise.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let him go about feeling how 
short-sighted, and stupid, and ignorant he is&mdash;and how 
infinitely wise Christ the Word of God is, by whom all things 
were made, to whom all belong.&nbsp; Let him go about wondering 
day and night, always astonished more and more, as everything he 
sees gives him some fresh proof of the glory of God; till he 
falls down on his knees and cries out with the Psalmist, 
&ldquo;Lord, what is man that Thou art mindful of him, or the son
of man, that Thou so regardest him?&rdquo;&nbsp; When I consider 
Thy Heavens, even the work of Thine hands, I say, What is man? 
and yet Thou madest man to have dominion over the works of Thine 
hands, and hast put all things in subjection under his 
feet&mdash;the fowl of the air and the fishes of the sea, and 
whatsoever walketh through the paths of the seas.&nbsp; O Lord, 
our Governor, how excellent is Thy name in all the world.&nbsp; 
In comparison of Thee what is man&rsquo;s wisdom?&nbsp; What is 
man&rsquo;s power?&nbsp; Thou alone art glorious, for by Thee are
all things, and for Thee they were made, and are created, that 
Thou mightest rejoice in the works of Thy own hands, and bless 
the creatures which Thy love has made!</p>

GOD.&nbsp; PREACHED TO SAILORS AT A LITTLE FISHING VILLAGE IN 
CORNWALL, 1843.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They that go down to the sea in ships, and 
occupy their business in great waters; these men see the works of
the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.&rdquo;&mdash;Ps. cvii. 23,
24.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My brothers&mdash;for though I do not know most of you even by
name, yet you are still my brothers, for His sake in whose name 
you were baptized&mdash;my brothers, it has been often said that 
seamen and fishermen ought to be the most religious men in the 
country.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Because they, more than any set of 
men, see the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep.</p>
<p>The cotton-spinner, who is shut up in a factory all day long, 
with nothing before his eyes but his loom, and nothing to look at
beyond his own house but dingy streets and smoking furnace 
chimneys&mdash;he, poor man, sees very little of the works of the
Lord.&nbsp; <i>Man</i> made the world of streets and shops and 
machinery in which that poor workman lives and dies.&nbsp; What 
wonder is it if he forgets the God who made him&mdash;the God who
made the round world, and set it so fast that it should not be 
moved, and has given the sea its bounds that it should not 
overflow them at any time?&nbsp; How much better off are you 
seamen than such a man as that!</p>
<p>And you are better off too, even, than most field <!-- page 
174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
174</span>labourers and farmers.&nbsp; They are not shut up in 
towns, it is true; they have God&rsquo;s beautiful earth to till 
and keep: but they are <i>too safe on shore</i>!&nbsp; Yes; it 
may seem a strange thing to say; but you ought to thank God that 
your trade is a dangerous one&mdash;you have more to put you in 
mind of God than the labouring man!</p>
<p>And why?&nbsp; In the first place, as I said, fishermen and 
sailors see more of the wonderful works of God than any other set
of men.&nbsp; Man may cut and change the earth&mdash;mining and 
quarrying and building&mdash;till it hardly looks like 
God&rsquo;s earth, but he cannot change the sea!&nbsp; There it 
is, just as God made it at first.&nbsp; Millions of rivers have 
run into it, yet it is not over full; cliffs have been wearing 
away and falling into it for six thousand years, yet is it not 
filled up.&nbsp; Millions of vessels have been sailing over it, 
yet they have left no mark upon it; it seems unchangeable, like 
God who made it.&nbsp; What is the use of my praising the sea to 
you?&nbsp; Do you not all know it, and fear it, and love it too? 
and does it not put you in mind of God who made it? who made that
mighty water for the use of men, and filled it with thousands of 
different kinds of fishes, and weeds, and wonderful things for 
your use and comfort; and who has made it so strong that it shall
keep you always in awe and fear and watchfulness, looking to God 
to save you&mdash;and yet so gentle and calm that you can sail 
upon its bosom, and there find food for your families.&nbsp; 
Which of you, who has any godly heart in him, can help feeling, 
sometimes at least when at sea, that he is seeing the wonderful 
works of God!</p>
<p>I said that you ought to thank God that your trade was a 
dangerous one, and I said that the sea should always keep you in 
fear and watchfulness, and looking to <!-- page 175--><a 
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>God to 
preserve you.&nbsp; Now, do you not see how these two sayings go 
together, and make each other plain.&nbsp; You seamen and 
fishermen are in continual danger; your lives are in your hands 
every moment&mdash;the belaying of a sheet, the strength of a bit
of canvas, the toughness of a deal board, may settle your fate in
a moment, and make all the difference between life and 
death.&nbsp; If they are sound, you may go back to a happy home, 
and see wife and children coming to meet you when you run on 
shore at morning from your honest labour; and if they 
fail&mdash;if that weak cordage, and these planks, and thinner 
canvas, on which your lives depend, do but give way, what is left
for you the next moment? what but a grave in the deep, deep sea, 
and your wives widows and your children orphans, and your bodies 
devoured by ugly creeping things, and your souls gone&mdash;gone 
where?&nbsp; My good men&mdash;you who sit around me now so 
strong and full of life and skill and happiness&mdash;where would
your souls be if you were drowned at sea to-morrow?</p>
<p>What a question!&nbsp; Oh, ask it yourselves honestly!&nbsp; I
have been out in gales myself, and I cannot understand how you 
can go out, in thirty feet of timber, upon that mighty sea, with 
the wind howling over your heads like a death-bell, and the great
hungry waves chasing you for miles, each one able and willing to 
swallow you up into the deep, and the gulls screaming over you as
if they were waiting to feed upon your floating carcases, and you
alone, in a tiny boat, upon that waste, howling wilderness of 
waters!&mdash;I cannot understand, I say, how, when a man is in 
such a case as that, day after day, year after year, he can 
forget his God, the only friend who can save him from the sea! 
the only friend who can send him safe out to his work in the 
evening, and bring him <!-- page 176--><a 
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>home safe 
to his wife at morning.&nbsp; One would think that when you went 
down to the shore in the morning, you would say, &ldquo;Oh, God! 
without whose help I am no stronger than a piece of sea-weed 
floating up and down, take care of me!&nbsp; Take care of my wife
and my children; and forgive me my sins, and do not punish me by 
calling me away this night to answer for them all!&rdquo;&nbsp; 
And when you come home at night, you would say, &ldquo;Oh, God! 
who hast kept me safe all this day, what can I do to show how 
thankful I am to Thee!&rdquo;&nbsp; Ay! what <i>can</i> you do to
show how thankful you are to God for His care?&nbsp; What 
<i>ought</i> you to do to show your thankfulness to Him?&nbsp; 
What <i>must</i> you do to show your thankfulness to Him?&nbsp; 
He has told you.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you love me, He says, keep my 
commandments.&nbsp; Do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with 
thy God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These, my friends, are the holy and thankful thoughts which 
ought to be in your hearts every day and hour.&nbsp; This is the 
thought which God meant to put into your hearts when He made 
sailors of you, and brought you into the world, by the sea-side, 
to take up your business in great waters.&nbsp; You might have 
been born in Bristol or Liverpool or London, and never seen 
anything but streets and houses, and man&rsquo;s clumsy 
work.&nbsp; But God has been very good to you.&nbsp; He has 
brought you up here, in this happy West country, where you may 
see His wonderful works day and night; where you ought never to 
forget that you have a Father in heaven who made the sea, and who
keeps you safe at sea by night and day.&nbsp; God has given you a
great deal.&nbsp; He has given you two books to read&mdash;the 
book of God&rsquo;s Word, the Bible, and the book of God&rsquo;s 
earth, the sky and sea and land, which is above you and below you
and <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>around you day and night.&nbsp; If 
you can read and understand them properly, you will find in them 
everything which you want; you may learn from them to be holy in 
this world and happy in the next.&nbsp; God has given you, too, 
fathers, mothers, wives, children, a comfortable home, a holy 
trade&mdash;the same which the apostles followed.&nbsp; God has 
given you England for your country, and the West 
country&mdash;the best place in England for your home.&nbsp; God 
has given you a good Queen, and good magistrates and 
landlords.&nbsp; God has given you health and strength, and 
seamanship, and clear heads and stout hearts.&nbsp; And God has 
made you seamen and fishermen, and given you a business in which 
you can see God&rsquo;s mighty power and wisdom day and night, 
and feel Him taking care of you when you cannot take care of 
yourselves.</p>
<p>Therefore you ought to thank God that yours is a dangerous 
business, because it teaches you to trust in God alone for 
safety.&nbsp; And what are you to give Him in return?&nbsp; What 
does God require of you?&nbsp; You cannot pay Him back again for 
all His mercies, for they are past counting, but you must pay Him
back all you can.&nbsp; And what must you pay Him back?&nbsp; 
First, you must trust in God; for he who comes to God and wishes 
to walk with God through life, as a good man should, must believe
that there is a God, and that He will reward those who look to 
Him.</p>
<p>I never heard of a sailor who did not <i>believe</i> in God; 
for how can a man look at the sea, and not say to himself, 
<i>God</i> made the sea!&nbsp; But I have seen a great many 
sailors who did not <i>trust</i> in God.&nbsp; As long as it is 
fine weather, and everything goes right, they will forget God, 
and fancy that it is their <!-- page 178--><a 
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>own 
seamanship, and not God alone, which keeps their boats afloat, 
and their own skill in fishing, and not God alone, which sends 
the shoals of fish into their nets; and so they are truly 
fine-weather sailors&mdash;men who are only fit for calm seas and
light breezes, when they can take care of themselves without 
God&rsquo;s help; but when a squall comes their hearts change, by
God&rsquo;s mercy.&nbsp; For when a man has done all he can to 
save himself, and all he can do is no use, and his nets are 
adrift, and his boat on her beam ends, and the foaming rocks are 
on his lee, then he comes to his senses at last, and prays.&nbsp;
Why did he not pray before?&nbsp; Why did he not save himself 
from all that misery and trouble and danger by thanking God for 
taking care of him, and praying to God to take care of him 
still.&nbsp; &ldquo;Foolish men are plagued for their offences, 
and because of their wickedness.&nbsp; They that go down to the 
sea in ships, and occupy their business on great waters; these 
men see the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep; for 
at His word the stormy wind ariseth which lifteth up the waves 
thereof; they are carried up to heaven, and down again into the 
deep; their soul melteth away because of the trouble; they reel 
to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their 
wit&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;&nbsp; And justly they are punished for 
forgetting God.&nbsp; God made the calm as well as the 
storm.&nbsp; Could they not remember that?&nbsp; But look at 
God&rsquo;s mercy; for when they cry unto the Lord in their 
trouble, He delivers them out of all their distress.&nbsp; For He
makes the storm to cease, so that the waves are still; then are 
they glad because they are at rest, and so God brings them to the
harbour where they would be.</p>
<p>Is there an old man sitting here who has not had this <!-- 
page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
179</span>happen to him?&nbsp; And what did you <i>do</i>, my 
friend, when God had saved you out of that danger?&nbsp; It is 
easy to tell what you <i>ought</i> to have done; you ought to 
have gone home and fallen on your knees, and prayed to God; you 
ought to have said, Oh, Lord, I am a miserable, foolish sinner, 
who can only remember Thee when Thou art angry; an ungrateful 
son, who only thinks of his father when he beats him!&nbsp; Oh, 
God, forgive me, I ought to have trusted in Thee before!&nbsp; I 
deserved all my danger and punishment and more.&nbsp; I did not 
deserve to be pardoned and saved from it!&nbsp; I deserve to be 
at the bottom of the sea at this moment.&nbsp; But forgive me, 
forgive me, loving and merciful Father, for the sake of Thy dear 
Son Jesus Christ, who died on the cross that I might be saved 
from death!</p>
<p>And when you had prayed thus, the next thing you ought to have
asked yourself was&mdash;What does God require of me? how can I 
try to pay Him back&mdash;how can I show that I am 
thankful?&nbsp; My good friends, what does God require of 
you?&nbsp; &ldquo;To do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk 
humbly with your God.&rdquo;&nbsp; I told you He required of you 
first to trust in Him at all hours, in all weathers.&nbsp; This 
is the next thing which He requires of you&mdash;To do justly, to
cheat no man, not in the price of a pilchard; to love mercy; to 
love your neighbours, as Christ loved you; to help your 
neighbours, as Christ helped you and all mankind, by dying to 
save you; and as Christ has helped you, night after night, when 
you might have been buried in the waves, if Christ had not prayed
for you that you might have time to repent, and bring forth 
fruits fit for repentance.&nbsp; To love mercy; to forgive every 
man who hurts you, for they are all Christian men and your <!-- 
page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
180</span>brothers.&nbsp; Christ loved every one!&nbsp; Why 
should not you?&nbsp; If your wife or friend loved anything, you 
would be kind to it for their sakes; and so, if you really love 
God, and are thankful to Him for all His mercy and kindness, you 
will love every man you meet, for God&rsquo;s sake, who loved 
them and gave His Son for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To walk humbly with your God.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is the 
beginning and end of all&mdash;you must be humble; you must 
confess that you are foolish, and God alone is wise; that you are
weak, and God alone is strong; that you are poor fishermen, whom 
any squall may drown, and that God is the Great, Loving, Almighty
God, who made heaven and earth, and the sea and all that is 
therein, and who helps all those who put their trust in 
Him.&nbsp; This is what God asks you to do in return for all He 
has done for you!&nbsp; To pray to Him, to praise Him, to put 
your trust in Him, to keep His commandments like thankful, 
humble, obedient, loving children.&nbsp; They who do these 
things, and only they, shall never fail.&nbsp; By night and day, 
in summer and winter, in storm and calm, in health and sickness, 
in richness and poverty, God will be with them.&nbsp; Christ will
be with them.&nbsp; He sat in a fisherman&rsquo;s boat once, on 
the sea of Tiberias, and He will sit in your boats if you will 
but ask Him.&nbsp; He will steer you, He will save you, He will 
take care of your wives and children when you are far away, and 
He will bring you through the troublesome waves of this mortal 
life, so that, having faith for your anchor, and hope for your 
sail, and charity for your crew, you may at last land on the 
happy shore of everlasting life, there to live with God, world 
without end.&nbsp; God grant it may be so!</p>
<p>My good brothers&mdash;for I am a Christian like you, and an 
Englishman like you, and a west countryman like <!-- page 
181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
181</span>you&mdash;I thank our Father in heaven that He has 
brought me from the other end of England, and put this message 
into my mouth, to remind you of who you are&mdash;that <i>you</i>
are the men who see the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the
deep; and that God will say to every one of you at the day of 
judgment,&mdash;I taught you all this, I gave you all this, I did
all this for <i>you</i>, what have you done for <i>Me</i> in 
return?</p>
<p>Go home&mdash;read over these verses in 107th Psalm, and think
over what I have said.&nbsp; Do it to-night, for the weather has 
broken up&mdash;there are gales coming.&nbsp; Which of you can 
say that he will be alive next Sunday?</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou therefore endure hardship as a good

<p>Suppose a young man went of his own will for a soldier; was

that a soldier need learn, as long as peace lasted.&nbsp; But 
suppose that, as soon as war came, and his regiment was ordered 
on active service, he deserted at once, and went off and hid 
himself.&nbsp; What should you call such a man?&nbsp; You would 
call him a base and ungrateful coward, and you would have no pity
on him, if he was taken and justly punished.</p>
<p>But suppose that he did a worse thing still.&nbsp; Suppose 
that the enemy, the Russians say, invaded England, and the army 
was called out to fight them; and suppose this man of whom I 
speak, be he soldier or sailor, instead of fighting the enemy, 
deserted over to them, and fought on their side against his own 
country, and his own comrades, and his own father and brothers, 
what would you call that man?&nbsp; No name would be bad enough 
for him.&nbsp; If he was taken, he would be hanged without mercy,
as not only a deserter but a traitor.&nbsp; <!-- page 183--><a 
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>And who 
would pity him or say that he had not got his just deserts?</p>
<p>Now, for God&rsquo;s sake and your own sakes consider.&nbsp; 
Are not all young people, when they are old enough to choose 
between right and wrong, if they choose what is wrong and live 
bad lives instead of good ones, very like this same deserter and 
traitor?</p>
<p>For are you not all Christ&rsquo;s soldiers, every one of 
you?&nbsp; Did not Christ enlist every one of you into His army, 
that, as the baptism service says, you might fight manfully under
His banner against sin, the world, and the devil,&mdash;in one 
word, against all that is wrong and bad?&nbsp; And now when you 
are old enough to know that you are Christ&rsquo;s soldiers, what
will you deserve to be called, if instead of fighting on 
Christ&rsquo;s side against what is good, you forget you are in 
His service?&nbsp; What are you but deserters from Christ&rsquo;s
banner and army, traitors to Christ&rsquo;s cause?</p>
<p>But some may say, &ldquo;My case is not like that 
soldier&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I did not enter Christ&rsquo;s service of 
my own free will.&nbsp; My parents put me into it when I was an 
infant, without asking my leave.&nbsp; I was not christened of my
own will.&nbsp; My parents had me christened before I knew any 
thing about it!&nbsp; I had no choice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is it so?&nbsp; Do you know what your words mean?&nbsp; If 
they mean anything, they mean that you had rather <i>not</i> have
been christened, because you are now expected to behave as a 
christened man should.&nbsp; Now is there any one of you who dare
say, &ldquo;I wish I had not been christened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not one!&nbsp; Then if you dare not say that; if you are 
content to have been christened, why are you not content to do 
what christened people should?&nbsp; If you <!-- page 184--><a 
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>are content
to have been christened, you are christened people now of your 
own free will, and are bound to act accordingly.</p>
<p>But why were you christened? not merely because your parents 
chose, but because it was their duty.&nbsp; Every child ought to 
be christened, because every child belongs to Christ.&nbsp; Every
child is in debt to Christ,&mdash;every child is bound to serve 
Christ.</p>
<p>In debt to Christ, you say?&nbsp; Certainly, from the moment 
you are born, and before that too.&nbsp; You are in debt to Him 
since you were born, for every good thought and feeling which 
ever came into your hearts and minds, for He put them 
there.&nbsp; And will any of you answer, &ldquo;Then I wish He 
had not put them there, if they are to bring me into debt to Him,
and force me to serve Him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish, of course, 
that I had been bad; but I wish that I had been neither good nor 
bad.&nbsp; I wish I had had no immortal soul, which is bound to 
serve Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now does any man of you wish that really?&nbsp; Dare any of 
you wish that you were like the beasts, without conscience, 
without honour, without shame, without knowing right from wrong, 
without any life after death, without being able even to 
<i>talk</i>&mdash;for mind, without immortal souls men could not 
<i>speak</i>.&nbsp; The beasts cannot talk to each other; 
reasonable speech belongs to our souls, not to our bodies.&nbsp; 
Then if you are glad that you have souls, and are better than the
dumb beasts, you confess that you feel in debt to Christ, and are
bound to serve Him.&nbsp; For who gave you your souls but 
Christ?</p>
<p>But even if you had had no souls, you would have been in debt 
to Christ, and bound to serve Him.&nbsp; <!-- page 185--><a 
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>&ldquo;What
for?&rdquo; you ask.&nbsp; Why, for life itself.&nbsp; How did 
you come here?&nbsp; Who gave you life?&nbsp; Who brought you 
into the world?&nbsp; Who but Christ, by whom all things were 
made, and you among the rest?&nbsp; Who gave you food?&nbsp; Who 
made every atom of food grow which you ate since you were 
born?&nbsp; Who made the air you breathe, the water which you 
drink, the wool and cotton which clothes you?&nbsp; Who but 
Christ?&nbsp; Do you not know that you cannot even breathe a 
breath of air, unless Christ first makes the air, and then gives 
your lungs life to breathe the air? and yet you cannot understand
that you are in debt to Christ, and have been eating His bread 
and living on His bounty ever since you were born?</p>
<p>And mind, all this while I have not said one word about the 
greatest debt of all which you owe to the Lord Jesus Christ, even
His own life, which He gave for you!&nbsp; Only think but once 
that for <i>your</i> sakes the Lord was crucified&mdash;for 
<i>your</i> sakes He died the most horrible, painful, shameful 
death.&nbsp; And then say, Are you not in debt to Him?&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his 
life for his friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; If any mere man had died for 
your sake, would you not love him&mdash;would you not feel 
yourself in debt to him, a deeper debt than you can ever 
repay?&nbsp; Then Christ died for you&mdash;how can you be more 
deeply in debt to any one than to Him?</p>
<p>You have now no <i>right</i> to choose between Christ and the 
devil, because Christ has chosen you already&mdash;no right to 
choose between good and bad, because God, the good God Himself, 
has chosen you already, and has been taking care of you, and 
heaping you with blessings ever since you were born.</p>
<p><!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>And why did Christ choose you?&nbsp; As I have told 
you, that you may fight with Him against all that is bad.&nbsp; 
Jesus Christ&rsquo;s work at which He works for ever in heaven 
and in earth, is to root out all that is bad, all sin, all 
misery; and He will reign, and He will fight till all His 
enemies, even Death itself, are put under His feet and 
destroyed.&nbsp; And Christ expects you and me to help Him.&nbsp;
He has chosen you and me, and all Christian people, to fight 
against what is bad, and to put it down and root it out as far as
we can wherever we find it; and therefore, first, to root it out 
of our own hearts and lives; for while we are bad ourselves we 
cannot make others good.&nbsp; But if we go on doing bad and 
wrong things, are we fighting on Christ&rsquo;s side?&nbsp; No, 
we are fighting on the devil&rsquo;s side, and helping the devil 
against God.</p>
<p>Do you fancy that I am saying too much?&nbsp; I suspect some 
do.&nbsp; I suspect some say in their hearts, &ldquo;He is too 
hard on us.&nbsp; <i>We</i> are not like that traitorous 
soldier.&nbsp; If an English soldier went over to the enemy, and 
fought against the English, and killed Englishmen, <i>that</i> of
course would be too bad; but we do not wish to harm any one, much
less our neighbours.&nbsp; If we do wrong, it is ourselves at 
most that we harm.&nbsp; If we do wrong, it is only we that shall
suffer for it.&nbsp; Why does he talk as if we were robbers or 
murderers, or had a spite against our neighbours?&nbsp; We do not
wish to hurt any one, we do not want to help the 
devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, my friends, if any of you say that, do you not say first 
what is not true? and next do you not know that it is not 
true?</p>
<p>First, It is not true that by doing wrong you hurt no one but 
yourself.&nbsp; Every wrong thing which any man <!-- page 
187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
187</span>does, every wrong way into which he runs, is certain 
sooner or later to hurt his neighbours.&nbsp; The worse man a man
is, the worse for those who have to do with him.&nbsp; You know 
it is your own case.&nbsp; You know that bad people hurt you, and
make you unhappy; and that good people do you good and make you 
happy.&nbsp; You know that bad example does you harm and good 
example does you good.&nbsp; Think for yourselves&mdash;use your 
own common sense.&nbsp; Recollect what you know, what has 
happened to you again and again.&nbsp; You know that if any one 
uses bad language before you, you are tempted to use bad language
too.&nbsp; If any one quarrels with you, you are tempted to 
quarrel with him.&nbsp; You know that if parents do wrong things 
before their children, the children learn to copy them.&nbsp; It 
is nonsense to talk of a man keeping his sins to himself.&nbsp; 
No man does, and no man can.&nbsp; Out of the abundance of a 
man&rsquo;s heart his mouth speaks; and a bad tree will bring 
forth bad fruit.&nbsp; If there are bad thoughts in your head, 
they will come out in bad words.&nbsp; If there are bad tempers 
in your heart, they will come out in bad and unkind and dishonest
actions.&nbsp; You may as well try to keep in fire, as to keep in
sin.&nbsp; It will break out, and it will burn whatever it 
touches.&nbsp; And if you, or I, or any one does wrong in any 
thing, we shall surely hurt some one or other by it.&nbsp; If 
you, or I, or any one is worse than he ought to be, we shall make
the parish we live in worse than it ought to be.&nbsp; You know 
that it is so.&nbsp; Who made you different from the rest of the 
world?&nbsp; If any body else&rsquo;s sins are harmful, who will 
make your sins harmless?&nbsp; Not the devil, for he wishes to 
see as much harm done as possible.&nbsp; And not God, for He will
not be so cruel as to let your sin prosper and go unpunished, 
<!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
188</span>as it would if it did not make people hate it, by 
feeling the bad effects of it.</p>
<p>My good friends, if you by doing wrong hurt other people, and 
make other people unhappy, are you doing Christ&rsquo;s work or 
the devil&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Are you fighting for Christ, who wishes 
to make all good, or for the devil, who wishes to make all 
bad?&nbsp; Are you Christ&rsquo;s faithful soldier and servant, 
or are you a traitor to Christ who has gone over to the 
devil&rsquo;s side, and is helping the devil to make this poor 
world (which is bad enough already) worse than it is?</p>
<p>Oh, think of this now, while you have time before you.&nbsp; 
Remember all that Christ has done for you, and remember that all 
He asks of you in return is to do for Him nothing but good, which
is good for you as well as for your neighbours.&nbsp; The 
devil&rsquo;s wages now are shame, discontent, unhappiness, 
perhaps poverty, perhaps sickness, certainly punishment as 
traitors to Christ after we die.&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s wages are 
love, joy, peace, the answer of a good conscience, the respect 
and love of all good men, as long as we live, and after death, 
life everlasting.&nbsp; Choose; will you be traitors or 
deserters, and serve the worst of all masters, the King of Hell, 
or be honest, honourable, and brave men, and serve the best of 
all masters, the King of Heaven, the Lord of Life, and love, and 
goodness without bound, whose ways are ways of pleasantness, and 
all His paths are peace?</p>

AND THE SINNER.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Have mercy upon, me, O God, according to 
thy loving-kindness; according unto the multitude of thy tender 
mercies blot out my transgressions.&nbsp; Wash me thoroughly from
mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.&nbsp; For I 
acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before 
me.&nbsp; The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and
a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not 
despise.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm</span> li. 1, 2, 
3, 17.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Psalm was written by David when he was sorrowing for sin,
and if there are any such among you, my dear friends, let me 
speak a few words to you.&nbsp; Would to God that I had the 
tongue of St. Paul to speak to you with&mdash;though even when he
preached some mocked, as it will be to the end.&nbsp; But if to 
one of you God has brought home His truth, then to that one 
conscience-stricken sinner I will say, &ldquo;You confess with 
David that all your sorrows are your own fault.&nbsp; Thank God 
that He has taught you so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what will you do to be saved from your sins?&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I cannot wait,&rdquo; you say in your heart, &ldquo;to go 
home and begin leading a new life.&nbsp; I will do that, please 
God, but I want to know at once that I am forgiven.&nbsp; I want 
to be saved.&nbsp; I cannot save myself.&nbsp; I cannot save 
myself from hell hereafter, or from this miserable sinful life, 
nearly as bad as hell here.&nbsp; Oh! wretched <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>being that 
I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this 
death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friend, dost thou not know it is written, &ldquo;Believe in 
the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ah yes</i>!&rdquo; <i>says the sinner</i>, 
&ldquo;<i>I have been hearing that all my life</i>, <i>and much 
good it has done me</i>!&nbsp; <i>Look at me</i>, <i>I want 
something more than those words about Christ</i>, <i>I want 
Christ Himself to save me if He can</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, my brother!&mdash;poor sinner! thou hast never believed in
Christ, thou hast only believed <i>about</i> Christ.&nbsp; There 
was the fault.&nbsp; But Christ Himself will save thee, though 
thou hast been the worst of reprobates, He will save thee.&nbsp; 
Only one thing, He <i>will</i> have thee answer first.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Dost thou wish to be saved from the <i>punishment</i> of 
thy sins, or from the sins themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>From my sins</i>&mdash;<i>from my sins</i>,&rdquo; 
says the man who truly repents.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>They are what I 
hate</i>, <i>even while I commit them</i>.&nbsp; <i>I hate and 
despise myself</i>, <i>I dare look neither God nor man in the 
face</i>, <i>and yet I go on doing the very things I loathe the 
next minute</i>.&nbsp; <i>Oh</i>, <i>for some one to save me from
my own ill-temper</i>, <i>my own bitter tongue</i>, <i>my own 
laziness</i>, <i>my own canting habits</i>, <i>my own 
dishonesty</i>, <i>my own lustfulness</i>.&nbsp; <i>But who will 
save me from them</i>? <i>who will change me and make a new 
creature of me</i>?&nbsp; <i>Oh</i>, <i>for a sign from heaven 
that I can get rid of these bad habits</i>!&nbsp; <i>I hate 
them</i>, <i>and yet I love them</i>.&nbsp; <i>I long to give 
them up</i>, <i>and yet</i>, <i>if some one stronger than me does
not have mercy on me</i>, <i>I shall go and do them again 
to-morrow</i>.&nbsp; <i>I am longing to do wrong now</i>, <i>and 
yet I long not to do wrong</i>.&nbsp; <i>Oh</i>, <i>for a sign 
from heaven</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor sinner!&mdash;My brother! <i>there</i> is a sign from 
heaven <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>for thee!&nbsp; On that table it 
stands.&nbsp; A sign that Christ&rsquo;s blood was shed to wash 
out thy sins, a sign that Christ&rsquo;s blood will feed thee, 
and give thy spirit strength to cast away and hate thy 
sins.&nbsp; Come to Holy Communion and claim thy share in 
Christ&rsquo;s pardon for the past, in Christ&rsquo;s strength 
for the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i>!&rdquo; says the sinner, &ldquo;<i>I come 
to the Sacrament</i>!&nbsp; <i>I of all men the most 
unfit</i>!&nbsp; <i>I who but yesterday committed such and such 
sins</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friend, as to the sin you committed yesterday, confess that to
God, not me.&nbsp; And if you confess it to Him, He is faithful 
and just to forgive it.&nbsp; But just because you think yourself
the most unfit person to come to the Holy Sacrament, for that 
very reason I suspect you to be fit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How then</i>!&rdquo; says he in his heart, 
&ldquo;<i>I have but this moment repented of my sins</i>!&nbsp; 
<i>I have but this moment</i>, <i>for the first time felt that 
God&rsquo;s wrath is revealed against me</i>, <i>that hell is 
open for me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For that very reason, come to the Holy Sacrament, and thou 
shalt hear there that not hell at all, but heaven is open for 
thee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i>, <i>with all this guilty conscience</i>, 
<i>this load of sins against myself</i>, <i>my neighbours</i>, 
<i>my children</i>, <i>my masters</i>, <i>my servants</i>, <i>on 
my back</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, bring them all, and say in the words of the Communion 
Service: &ldquo;I do earnestly repent, and am heartily sorry for 
these, my misdoings; the remembrance of them is grievous unto me;
the burden of them is intolerable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why, for whom 
were these words written, but for you who feel that the burden of
your sins is intolerable.&nbsp; They are there, not for those who
feel no burden of sin, but for you&mdash;for <!-- page 192--><a 
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>you, and 
for those like you who feel the burden of your sins 
unbearable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>But how shall I dare to come to the Lord&rsquo;s 
table before I am sure that my sins are forgiven</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Come and you will hear your minister pray God to pardon and 
deliver you from all for Christ&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; You will hear
him read God&rsquo;s promises of free grace and mercy through 
Jesus Christ to all who truly repent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>But I cannot trust your prayers or words</i>, <i>or 
any man&rsquo;s</i>.&nbsp; <i>I want a sign that I have a share 
in Christ&rsquo;s death and merits</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, that bread and wine is a sign.&nbsp; Jesus Himself 
ordained them for a sign.&nbsp; He Himself, with His dying voice 
declared that that bread was His body, that cup the new covenant 
in His blood.&nbsp; St. Paul declares that it is the communion, 
the sharing of Christ&rsquo;s body, that cup the sharing of His 
blood.&nbsp; What more sign do you want?&nbsp; Come and claim 
your share in Christ, and see if He disappoints you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ah</i>!&nbsp; <i>I believe</i>,&rdquo; <i>says the 
poor man</i>, &ldquo;<i>I believe</i>, <i>but I am afraid</i>, 
<i>afraid of partaking unworthily</i>, <i>and so provoking 
God</i>, <i>as the Prayer-book says to plague me with divers 
diseases and sundry kinds of death</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My Friend, if God was the devil, you might be afraid 
indeed.&nbsp; But He is the loving, righteous Father, who knows 
your weakness, and remembers that you are but dust.&nbsp; Can you
not trust Him to pardon your mistakes about the Sacrament, which 
you do not wilfully intend to commit, when He has borne with, and
pardoned all the sins from your youth up until now, which you 
have wilfully committed?&nbsp; Surely, you may trust Him in such 
a thing as this,&mdash;He who has had long-suffering enough to 
keep you alive, with a chance of salvation all this time? <!-- 
page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
193</span>and as for sundry diseases, <i>have</i> you avoided 
them?&nbsp; You have certainly not avoided them, at least, by 
staying away from the Sacrament, and breaking Christ&rsquo;s 
command to take it?&nbsp; If you are so afraid of God&rsquo;s 
anger, are you more likely to provoke Him by disobeying His 
strict commands, or by obeying them?&nbsp; It needs no 
philosopher, my friend, to find out that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>But I shall have to make good 
resolutions</i>,&rdquo; <i>says the sinner</i>, &ldquo;<i>and I 
am afraid of breaking them</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, if you break them, you can but make them again.&nbsp; 
You would call him a fool who determined never to walk, because 
he was afraid of falling.&nbsp; But you are to claim in that 
Sacrament your share of Christ&rsquo;s Spirit, Christ&rsquo;s 
life, and Christ&rsquo;s strength, which is just what you want to
enable you to keep your good resolutions.&nbsp; You will be no 
stronger, no more righteous of yourself after the Sacrament than 
before.&nbsp; Your spirit will still be a poor weak sinful 
spirit, but you will have claimed your share in God&rsquo;s 
strength, God&rsquo;s righteousness, God&rsquo;s Spirit, and 
<i>they</i> will make you love the good you hated, and hate the 
evil you loved.&nbsp; They will make you strong to do God&rsquo;s
will whatever it may cost you.&nbsp; Oh believe the good news, 
and show that you believe by coming to Christ.&nbsp; He, the 
Blessed One, died for you.&nbsp; For you He was born and walked 
this earth, a poor suffering, tempted, sorrow-stricken man.&nbsp;
For you He hung upon the shameful cross.&nbsp; For you He 
ascended up on high.&nbsp; For you He sent down His Spirit.&nbsp;
For you He sits at the right hand of God, praying for you at this
moment.&nbsp; For you He gave the signs of His body and His 
blood, that you might believe, and fall on your knees and cry, 
&ldquo;In spite of all, I am forgiven.&nbsp; In spite of all, God
cares for me.&nbsp; In spite of all, I have a <!-- page 194--><a 
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>Father and 
a Saviour who will never leave me, nor forsake me, wretch as I 
have been, till they make a man of me again, in this world, and 
for ever!&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh! come, my dear, dear friends.&nbsp; I 
would give my right hand this moment, if I could but see each and
every one of you shewing the truth of your repentance by coming 
to Holy Communion.&nbsp; Let this be a day of repentance, and 
shew it thus, and say, &ldquo;We do not come to this, Thy table, 
O Lord, trusting in our own righteousness, but in Thy manifold 
and great mercy.&nbsp; We are not worthy to gather up the crumbs 
under Thy table, but Thou art the same Lord whose property is 
always to have mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let this be a day of thanksgiving, too, and shew your 
thankfulness by coming to Holy Communion, and lifting up your 
voices, once for all, at that table, and saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We bless Thee, we praise Thee, we glorify Thee, we give
thanks to Thee for Thy great glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are the 
words for you this day.&nbsp; Oh! do not turn away.&nbsp; All 
your distress, all your sorrows have come from your not having 
faith in God.&nbsp; Break at once the accursed charm with which 
the devil has enchanted you.&nbsp; Have faith enough to come to 
God&rsquo;s holy table, and see if God does not reward you by 
giving you faith enough to conquer yourselves, and lead new lives
like redeemed men in the sunshine of His smile, henceforth and 
forever!</p>
<p>My friends, what more can I say, except once and again, Come 
ye who labour and are heavy laden, and Christ will give you 
rest!</p>
<p>Ay, and He will.&nbsp; I speak only what I know&mdash;what I 
have felt.&nbsp; But before He will give you rest, be you rich or
poor, young or old, you must learn to say those <!-- page 
195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
195</span>simple words (they are the best and only preparation 
for it), &ldquo;God be merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; Say 
them then from your heart, and so come to the Lord&rsquo;s 
Supper.</p>
<h4>A PRAYER.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;O God and Saviour, Thou hast blest me, and I have 
cursed myself.&nbsp; Thou didst die to deliver me from the curse 
of sin, and I have brought it back on myself by my own 
folly.&nbsp; Thou livest for ever to make me <i>good</i>, and I, 
ungrateful and foolish, have made myself <i>bad</i>.&nbsp; In 
spite of my ingratitude, in spite of my folly, take me back into 
Thy service.&nbsp; I trust utterly in Thy unchangeable goodness 
and mercy.&nbsp; I trust that Thy blood will still wash away the 
past, that Thy spirit will still give me a clean heart and a 
right spirit.&nbsp; I believe that though I have cursed myself, 
yet Thou wilt still bless me; for Thou wiliest nought but the 
good of every creature Thou hast made.&nbsp; God be merciful to 
me a sinner!&rdquo;&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<p>My friends,&mdash;I speak to you simply as brave men.&nbsp; I 
speak alike to Roman Catholic and Protestant.&nbsp; I speak alike
to godly men and ungodly.&nbsp; I speak alike to soldiers and 
sailors. . . . If you are <i>brave</i>, read these words.&nbsp; I
call these <i>brave</i> words.&nbsp; They are not my <i>own</i> 
words, or my own message, but the message to you of the bravest 
man who ever lived, or who ever will live, and if you will read 
them and think over them, He will not <i>make</i> you brave (for 
that, thank God, you are already), but <i>keep</i> you brave, 
come victory or defeat.&nbsp; I speak to the brave men who have 
now fought three bloody battles, and fought them like 
heroes.&nbsp; All England has blessed you, and admired you; all 
England has felt for you in a way that would do your hearts good 
to see.&nbsp; For you know as well as I, that nothing is so 
comforting, nothing so endearing, as sympathy, as <i>to know that
people feel for one</i>.&nbsp; If one knows that, one can dare 
and do anything.&nbsp; If one feels that nobody cares for 
one&rsquo;s suffering or one&rsquo;s success, one is ready to lie
down and die.&nbsp; It is so with a horse or a dog even.&nbsp; If
there is any noble spirit in them, a word of encouragement will 
make them go till they drop.&nbsp; How much more will the spirit 
of a <i>man</i>?&nbsp; I can well <!-- page 200--><a

ears, you will prove true to the last, to the words of the grand 
old song&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hearts of oak are our ships, hearts of oak 
are our men,<br />
And we&rsquo;ll fight, and we&rsquo;ll conquer again, and 
again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, my friends, you know as well as I, that there are times 
when neither that letter, nor the feeling of duty, nor of honour,
nor of glory, can keep your hearts from sinking.&nbsp; Not in 
battle!&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Only cowards&rsquo; hearts fail them 
there; and there are no cowards among you.&nbsp; But even a brave
man&rsquo;s heart may fail him at whiles, when, instead of the 
enemy&rsquo;s balls and bayonets, he has to face delay, and 
disappointment, and fatigue, and sickness, and hunger, and cold, 
and nakedness; as you have, my brave brothers, and faced them as 
well as man ever did on earth.&nbsp; Ah! it must be fearful work 
to <i>sit still</i>, and shiver and starve in a foreign land, and
to think of those who are in comfort and plenty at home; and 
worse, to think of those, who, even if they are in plenty, cannot
be in comfort, because their hearts are breaking for your sake; 
to think of brother and sister, wife and child, while you are 
pacing up and down those dreary trenches, waiting for your turn 
of sickness, perhaps of death.&nbsp; It must be bitter and 
disheartening at times; you would not be men, if it was 
not.&nbsp; One minute, perhaps, you remember that those whom you 
have left at home, love you and pray for you; and that cheers 
you; then you remember that all England loves you, and prays for 
you in every church throughout the land; and that cheers you; but
even that is not <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>enough, you feel ready to say, 
&ldquo;What is the use of my going through all this misery?&nbsp;
Why am I not at home ploughing the ground, or keeping a shop, 
anything rather than throwing away my life by inches thus.&nbsp; 
My people at home feel for me, but they cannot know, they never 
will know, the half of what I have gone through.&nbsp; The nation
will provide for me if I am crippled, but they cannot make up to 
me for losing the best years of my life in such work as this; 
and, if I am killed, can they make up to me for that?&nbsp; Who 
can make up to me for my life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Have you not had such thoughts, my friends, and sadder 
thoughts still lately?&nbsp; You need not be ashamed of them if 
you have.&nbsp; For hard work you have had, and it must have told
at times on your spirits as heavily as it has on your bodies.</p>
<p>But, my friends, there is an answer for these sad 
thoughts.&nbsp; There are brave words for you, and a noble 
message from God, which will cheer you when nothing else can 
cheer you.&nbsp; If your own people cannot know all that you go 
through, there is One who can and does; if your own wives and 
mothers cannot feel enough for you, there is One above who does, 
and He is the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; You have hungered; so has 
He.&nbsp; You have been weary; so has He.&nbsp; You have felt 
cold and nakedness; so has He.&nbsp; You have been houseless and 
sleepless, so has He.&nbsp; While the foxes had holes, and the 
birds of the air had nests, He, the maker of them all, had not 
where to lay His head.&nbsp; You have felt the misery of 
loneliness and desolation; but never so much as did He, when not 
only every earthly friend forsook Him and fled, but He cried out 
in His very death pangs, &ldquo;My God, my God, why hast Thou 
forsaken me?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>Above all, you have felt how difficult it was to die, 
not fighting sword in hand, but slowly and idly, and helplessly, 
by cholera or fever, hunger or cold.&nbsp; Terrible it is; but 
the Lord Jesus Christ has felt that too.&nbsp; For three years He
looked death in the face&mdash;a death of shame and misery such 
as you can never die&mdash;and faced it, and gave Himself up to 
it of His own free will; and though He had the most horrible fear
of it to the very last, He determined to submit to it, in spite 
of His own fear of it; and He did submit to it, and died, and so 
<i>showed</i>, <i>even in His very fear</i>, <i>the most perfect 
and glorious courage</i>.&nbsp; So if any one of you has ever 
felt for a single moment <i>afraid</i>; even in <i>that</i>, the 
Lord Jesus Christ can feel for you; for He, too, has gone through
the agony of fear, when His sweat was as great drops of blood 
falling to the ground, that He might be able to help you, and 
every man that is tempted, because He can be touched with the 
feeling of your infirmities, having gone through every temptation
which flesh is heir to, and conquered them all.</p>
<p>This, then, is one half (and only one half) of my good news; 
that you have a Friend in heaven who feels for every trouble of 
yours, better than your own mothers can feel for you, because He 
has been through it all already; you have a Friend in heaven who 
is praying for you day and night, more earnestly, lovingly, 
wisely, than your own wives and children are praying for 
you.&nbsp; But that is not all.&nbsp; God forbid!&nbsp; You have 
a Friend in heaven, for whose sake God will forgive you all your 
sins and weaknesses, as often as you heartily confess them to 
Him, and trust in Him for a full and free pardon.&nbsp; You have 
a Friend in heaven who will help you day by day, where you most 
need help, in your hearts and <!-- page 203--><a 
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>spirits; 
who will give you, if you ask Him, <i>His Spirit</i>, the same 
spirit of duty, courage, endurance, love, self-sacrifice, which 
made Him brave to endure ten thousand times more than any soldier
or sailor can endure, for the sake of doing His Father&rsquo;s 
will, and saving a ruined world.</p>
<p>Oh! open your hearts to Him, my brave men, in your lonely 
night-watches&mdash;on your sick beds; ay, in the very roar of 
battle itself, ask Him to make you true and good, patient, calm, 
prudent, honourable, obedient, gentle, even in the hottest of the
fight.&nbsp; Commit to Him your own lives and fortunes, and the 
lives and fortunes of those who have been left at home, and be 
sure that He, your Unseen Friend of friends, is able and willing 
to help to the uttermost all that you put into His charge.</p>
<p>But, again, my men, if the nation cannot reward you for 
sacrificing your life in a just war, there is One above who can, 
and who will, too; for He is as just as He is loving, and as 
loving as He is just, and that is the same of whom I have spoken 
already, the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I think some of you will fancy this almost too good news to be
true, and yet the very news which you want to hear.&nbsp; I think
some of you have been saying as you read this, &ldquo;All this is
blessed and comforting news for poor fellows lying wounded in a 
hospital, or fretting their souls away about the wives and 
children they have left behind; blessed and comforting news; but 
we want something more than that even.&nbsp; We have to fight and
to kill; we want to be sure that God&rsquo;s blessing is on our 
fighting and our killing; we have to go into battle; and we want 
to know that there, too, we are <!-- page 204--><a 
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>doing 
God&rsquo;s work, and to be sure that God is on our 
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, my brave men, <i>Be sure of it then</i>!&nbsp; Be sure 
that God&rsquo;s blessing is as much upon you; be sure that you 
are doing God&rsquo;s work, as much when you are handling a 
musket or laying a gun in your country&rsquo;s battles, as when 
you are bearing frost and hunger in the trenches, and pain and 
weakness on a sick bed.</p>
<p>For the Lord Jesus Christ is not only the <i>Prince of 
Peace</i>; He is the <i>Prince of War</i> too.&nbsp; He is the 
Lord of Hosts, the God of armies; and whosoever fights in a just 
war, against tyrants and oppressors, he is fighting on 
Christ&rsquo;s side, and Christ is fighting on his side; Christ 
is his Captain and his Leader, and he can be in no better 
service.&nbsp; Be sure of it; for the Bible tells you so.&nbsp; 
The old wars of Abraham against the robber-kings; of Joshua 
against the Canaanites; of David against the Philistines; of 
Hezekiah against the Assyrians; of the Maccabees against the 
Greeks&mdash;all tell the soldier the same brave news, that he is
doing God&rsquo;s work, and that God&rsquo;s blessing is on him, 
when he fights in a just cause.&nbsp; And you are fighting in a 
just cause, if you are fighting for freedom and law.&nbsp; If to 
you God gives the noble work of fighting for the liberty of 
Europe, God will reward you according as you do that work like 
men.&nbsp; You will be fighting in that everlasting war which is 
in heaven; in God&rsquo;s everlasting war against all injustice 
and wrong, the Captain and Leader whereof is the Lord Jesus 
Christ Himself.&nbsp; Believe that&mdash;for the Bible tells it 
you.&nbsp; You must think of the Lord Jesus Christ, not merely as
a sufferer, but as a warrior; not merely as the Man of Sorrows 
(blessed as that thought is), but as the Lord of Hosts&mdash;the 
God of <!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>armies&mdash;the King who executes 
justice and judgment in the earth, who has sworn vengeance 
against all unrighteousness and wrong, and will destroy the 
wicked with the breath of His mouth.&nbsp; You must think of Him 
as the God of the fatherless and the widow; but you must think of
Him, too, as the God of the sailor and the soldier, the God of 
duty, the God of justice, the God of vengeance, the God to whom 
<i>your colours were solemnly offered</i>, and <i>His blessing on
them prayed for</i>, when they were given to your regiment.</p>
<p>I know that you would follow those colours into the mouth of 
the pit, that you would die twice over sooner than let them be 
taken.&nbsp; Good! but remember, too, that those colours are a 
sign to you that Christ is with you, ready to give you courage, 
coolness, and right judgment, in the charge and in the death 
grapple, just as much as He is with those ministering angels who 
will nurse and tend your wounds in hospital.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s 
blessing is on them; but do you never forget that your colours 
are a sign to you that Christ&rsquo;s blessing is on 
<i>you</i>.&nbsp; If they do not mean that to you, what was the 
use of blessing them with prayer?&nbsp; It must have been a lie 
and a sham.&nbsp; But it is no lie, brave men, and no sham; it is
a glorious truth, of which those noble rags, inscribed with noble
names of victory, should remind you every day and every hour, 
that he who fights for Queen and country in a just cause, is 
fighting not only in the Queen&rsquo;s army, but in 
Christ&rsquo;s army, and that he shall in no wise lose his 
reward.</p>
<p>Are not these brave words for brave soldiers?&nbsp; Well: they
are not mine; they are the Bible&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The book of 
Revelation tells us how St. John saw a vision of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and of His everlasting war against <!-- page 206--><a 
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>wrong, of 
which I spoke just now.&nbsp; And what did the Lord appear 
like?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And I saw heaven opened</i>, <i>and behold a white 
horse</i>; <i>and he that sat upon him is called Faithful and 
True</i>, <i>and in righteousness He doth judge and make 
war</i>.&nbsp; <i>And His eyes were as a flame of fire</i>; 
<i>and He was clothed in a garment dipped in blood</i>; <i>and 
His name is called the Word of God</i>.&nbsp; <i>And the armies 
in heaven followed Him</i>, <i>riding upon white horses</i>, 
<i>clothed in fine linen</i>, <i>white and clean</i>.&nbsp; 
<i>And out of His mouth goeth a sharp sword</i>, <i>that He 
should smite the nations</i>; <i>and He shall rule them with a 
rod of iron</i>; <i>and He treadeth the winepress of the 
fierceness and of the wrath of almighty God</i>&rdquo; (Rev. xix.
11).</p>
<p>Are not these brave words, my friends?&nbsp; Are not these 
soldier-like words?&nbsp; Is not this a general worth 
following?&nbsp; Is not this a charge of cavalry worth sharing 
in?&nbsp; Then believe that that general, the Lord Jesus Christ, 
is your general.&nbsp; Believe that you are sharing in that 
everlasting charge, to which the glorious charge of Balaclava was
as nothing; the everlasting war which the Lord Jesus wages 
against all sin, and cruelty, and wrong&mdash;in which He will 
never draw bridle-rein, or sheath His sword, till He has put all 
enemies under His feet, and swept all oppression, injustice, and 
wickedness off the face of the earth which God has given Him.</p>
<p>Therefore I can say to you other brave words, my friends (and 
not my own, but the words of the same Lord Jesus 
Christ):&mdash;&ldquo;Fear not them that can kill the body, and 
after that have no more that they can do.&nbsp; But I will 
forewarn you whom you shall fear; fear him who after he has 
killed has power to destroy both body and soul in 
hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>Now all England knows already that you do not fear 
those who can kill the body; but I sometimes fear that some of 
you are not enough afraid of that enemy worst of all, who can 
kill the soul too.&nbsp; And who is that?&nbsp; St. Paul tells 
us.&nbsp; He is &ldquo;the devil, who has the power of 
death,&rdquo; who lies in ambuscade to destroy your body and soul
in hell; and will and can do it; <i>but only if you let 
him</i>.&nbsp; Now who is the devil?&nbsp; It is worth your while
to know; for many a man may be, as you are, in the ranks of 
God&rsquo;s army, and yet doing the devil&rsquo;s work all the 
while.&nbsp; Many a man may fancy himself a good soldier, and 
forget that a soldier is a man, and something more; and that 
therefore, before you can be a good soldier, you must first be 
more or less of a good man.&nbsp; Do you think not?&nbsp; Look 
then, and see whether the most upright and god-fearing men in 
your ranks are not in the long run the best soldiers.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t mean merely the best <i>fighters</i>&mdash;the 
bravest men in battle.&nbsp; There goes more than mere bull-dog 
pluck to the making of a soldier; and to make a good soldier, I 
hold that a man, though he be afraid of nothing else, must be 
horribly afraid of the devil, and <i>that the better and braver 
soldier he is</i>, <i>the more afraid of the devil he will 
be</i>.</p>
<p>Of course that depends upon who the devil is.&nbsp; I will 
tell you.&nbsp; He is what his name means, <i>the accuser and the
divider</i>&mdash;the evil spirit who sets men against each 
other&mdash;men against officers, and officers against men; who 
sets men grumbling, puts hard suspicious thoughts into their 
minds; makes them selfish and forgetful of their duty, tempts 
them to care only for themselves, and help themselves.&nbsp; You 
must see that if those tempers once got head in an army, there 
would be an <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>end of all discipline&mdash;of all 
obedience; and what is more, of all courage; for if the devil 
could completely persuade every man to care only for himself, the
plain thing for every man to do, would be to turn round and run 
for his life.&nbsp; That you will never do; but you may give way 
to the devil in lesser matters, and so do God&rsquo;s work ill, 
and lose your own reward from God.&nbsp; All grumbling, and hard 
speeches, and tale-bearing is doing the devil&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;
All disorder and laziness is doing the devil&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; 
All cruelty and brutality is doing the devil&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Now as to cruelty and brutality, some soldiers fancy when 
towns are taken in war, that they may do things for which (to 
speak the truth) <i>they ought to be hanged</i>.&nbsp; I mean in 
plain English, ravishing the women, and ill-treating unarmed men,
to make them give up their money.&nbsp; <i>Whosoever does these 
things</i>, <i>God&rsquo;s curse is on him</i>, and his sin will 
surely find him out.&nbsp; No excuse of being in hot blood will 
avail him.&nbsp; No excuse of having fought well beforehand will 
avail him.&nbsp; Such cant will no more excuse him with God than 
it will with truly noble-minded men.&nbsp; He may have been brave
enough before, but he is doing a coward&rsquo;s deed then; he is 
doing the devil&rsquo;s work, <i>and the devil</i>, <i>and not 
God</i>, <i>will pay him his wages</i>, <i>to the uttermost 
farthing</i>.&nbsp; But though I tell you to fear the devil, it 
is only to fear his getting the command over you.&nbsp; The devil
is a liar, and a liar is always a coward.&nbsp; Be brave in 
God&rsquo;s service.&nbsp; &ldquo;Resist the devil and he will 
flee from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One word more.&nbsp; If any of you are maddened by hearing of 
the enemy murdering some of your wounded&mdash;recollect that 
<i>revenge</i> is one of the devil&rsquo;s works, of which the 
brave men cannot be too much afraid.&nbsp; God <!-- page 209--><a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>forbid that
you should ever be maddened into imitating such cruelty.&nbsp; 
Fight the enemy in God&rsquo;s name&mdash;and strike home; but 
never have on your conscience the thought that you struck <i>an 
unnecessary blow</i>.&nbsp; <i>You are to kill for the sake of 
victory</i>, <i>but never to kill for the sake of 
killing</i>.&nbsp; You know who it was who prayed for and excused
His own murderers as He hung upon the cross.&nbsp; &ldquo;Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they do.&rdquo;&nbsp; That 
was the same Lord Jesus who, as I told you, is the great Warrior 
against all wrong.&nbsp; If He was not ashamed to forgive, do you
not be ashamed either.&nbsp; You cannot be more brave than He is;
try, at least, to be merciful like Him.&nbsp; Overcome evil with 
good; by returning good for evil you will not only help 
England&rsquo;s cause by softening the hearts of your enemies, 
but you will preach Christ&rsquo;s gospel to them&mdash;and in 
nowise lose your reward.</p>
<p>Remember then, always, our Lord Jesus Christ is the pattern of
a perfect warrior, whether by land or sea; and if you be like 
Him, and fighting <i>not only on His side</i>, <i>but as He likes
to see you fight</i>, that is, righteously and mercifully against
the tyrants of the earth&mdash;what harm can happen to you?&nbsp;
Be sure that whether you live, you will live to Him; or whether 
you die, you die to Him; that living or dying you will be His; 
and that He is merciful (the Bible says) in this, that He rewards
every man according to his work.&nbsp; Do you your work like men,
and be sure that the Lord Jesus Christ will see that you are 
right well paid, if not in this life, still in that life to come,
to which may He bring you and all brave men, who will strive to 
do their duty in that station of life to which God has called 
them.</p>
<h3><!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>II.&nbsp; THE STORY OF CORTEZ; OR 
PLUCK IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.&nbsp; A LECTURE DELIVERED AT 
ALDERSHOT CAMP, NOV. 1858.</h3>
<p>It seemed to me that, having to speak to-night to soldiers, 
that I ought to speak <i>about</i> soldiers.&nbsp; Some story, I 
thought, about your own profession would please you most and 
teach you most.&nbsp; Some story, I say, for it is not my 
business to tell you what soldiers ought to be like.&nbsp; That, 
I daresay, you know a great deal better than I; and I only hope I
may do my duty as a parson half as well as British soldiers do 
their duty, and will always do it.</p>
<p>So I thought of telling you to-night some sort of a 
story&mdash;a true one, of course, about wars and 
battles&mdash;some story about the British army; but then I 
thought there are plenty of officers who can do that far better 
than I,&mdash;so I will take some story of foreign armies, and 
one of old times too.&nbsp; And though no soldier myself, but 
only a scholar, and reader of queer old books, I may make my 
scholarship of some use to you who have to drill and fight, and 
die too, for us comfortable folks who sit at home and read our 
books by our fireside.</p>
<p>Then I thought of the story of Cortez the Spaniard, and how he
conquered the great empire of Mexico with a handful of brave 
men.&nbsp; That, I thought, would be an <!-- page 211--><a 
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>example to 
you of what men can do who have stout hearts and good weapons, 
and who have faith too in God, and believe that if they do their 
duty God will prosper them.&nbsp; And I thought I could do it all
the better, because I like the story, and enjoy reading it again 
and again; for I know no such dashing and desperate deed of 
courage in history, except Havelock&rsquo;s advance upon 
Lucknow.</p>
<p>So now I will begin my story, telling you first where Mexico 
is, and what it was like when Cortez landed in it, more than 
three hundred years ago.</p>
<p>You, all of you, have heard of the West India 
station&mdash;some of you have been there.&nbsp; Beyond those 
West India Islands lies the great Gulf of Mexico, and beyond that
the mainland of North America, and Mexico itself.&nbsp; It is now
thinly peopled by Spaniards, the descendants of settlers who came
over after Cortez&rsquo;s time; and a very lazy, cowardly set 
most of them are,&mdash;very different from the old heroes, their
forefathers.&nbsp; Our Yankee cousins can lick them now, one to 
five, and will end, I believe, in conquering the whole 
country.&nbsp; But in Cortez&rsquo;s time, the place was very 
different.&nbsp; It was full of vast numbers of heathens, 
brownish coloured people, something like the Red Indians you see 
in Canada, but a fairer, handsomer, stouter, heavier-bodied race;
and much more civilised also.&nbsp; They had great cities and 
idol temples, aqueducts for water, and all sorts of noble 
buildings, all of most curiously carved stone; which is all the 
more wonderful and creditable to them, when we remember that they
had no iron&mdash;not a knife&mdash;not a nail of iron among 
them.&nbsp; But they had found out how to make bronze by mixing 
tin and copper, and with it could work the hardest stones, as 
<!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
212</span>well as we can with iron.&nbsp; They had another stuff 
which was curious enough, of which they made knives, razors, 
arrow heads, and saw-edged swords as keen as razors&mdash;and 
that was <i>glass</i>.&nbsp; They did not make the 
glass&mdash;they found it about the burning mountains, of which 
Mexico is full; itztli they called it; we call it obsidian.&nbsp;
It is tougher than our glass, and chips to a fine razor 
edge.&nbsp; I have seen arrows of it, which I am certain would go
clean through a man, and knives which would take his arm off, 
bone and all.&nbsp; I want you to remember these glass weapons, 
for Cortez&rsquo;s Spaniards had cause enough to remember them 
when they came to fight.&nbsp; Gunpowder, of course, they knew 
nothing of, nor of horses or cattle either.&nbsp; They had no 
beasts of draught; and all the stones and timber for their 
magnificent buildings were carried by hand.&nbsp; But they were 
first-rate farmers; and for handicraft work, such as pottery, 
weaving, and making all kinds of ornaments, I can answer for it, 
for I have seen a good deal of their work&mdash;they had not then
their equals in the world.&nbsp; They made the most beautiful 
dresses out of the feathers of birds&mdash;parrots, humming 
birds, and such like, which fill the forests in hot 
countries.&nbsp; And what was more, their country abounded in 
gold and jewels, and they knew how to work them, just as well as 
we do.&nbsp; They could work gold into the likeness of flowers, 
of birds with every feather like life, and into a thousand 
trinkets.&nbsp; Their soil was most fruitful of all that man can 
want&mdash;there was enough of the best for all to eat; and 
altogether there never was a richer, and need never have been a 
happier people, if they had but been good.&nbsp; But that was 
just what they were not.&nbsp; A bad lot they were, cruel and 
blood-thirsty, continually at war <!-- page 213--><a 
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>with each 
other; and as for cruelty, just take this one story.&nbsp; At the
opening of a great temple to one of their idols in 1486, about 
thirty years before the Spaniards came, they sacrificed to the 
idol seventy-thousand human beings!</p>
<p>This offering in sacrifice of human beings to their idols was 
their regular practice.&nbsp; They got these poor creatures by 
conquering all the nations round, and carrying back their 
prisoners to sacrifice; and if they failed, they took poor people
of their own, for blood they and their false gods must 
have.&nbsp; Men, and sometimes women and children, were murdered 
by them in their temples, often with the most horrible tortures, 
to the number, I am afraid there is no doubt of it, of many 
thousands every year; and their flesh afterwards cooked 
delicately, was eaten as a luxury by people who, as far as 
outward show went, were just as fine gentlemen and ladies as 
there are now.</p>
<p>When the Spaniards got into Mexico, they found the walls of 
the temples crusted inches thick in blood, the altars of the 
idols heaped with smoking human hearts, and whole houses full of 
skulls.&nbsp; They counted in one house one hundred and 
thirty-six thousand skulls.&nbsp; It was high time to get rid of 
those Mexicans off the face of the earth; and in God&rsquo;s good
time a man was found to rid the earth of them, and that man was 
Hernando Cortez.</p>
<p>And who was Cortez?&nbsp; He was a poor young Spanish 
gentleman, son of an infantry captain, who, in his youth, was 
sickly and weakly; and his father tried to make a lawyer of him, 
and would have done it, but young Cortez kicked over the traces, 
as we say, right and left, and turned out such a wild fellow, 
<!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
214</span>that he would not stay at college; and after getting 
into plenty of scrapes, started as a soldier to the West Indies 
when he was only nineteen.&nbsp; Little did people think what 
stuff there was in that wild, sickly lad!</p>
<p>How he got on in the Spanish West Indies would be a long 
story.&nbsp; I will only tell you that he turned out a thoroughly
good soldier, and a very dashing smart fellow, a first-rate rider
and fencer, a great dandy in his dress; but also&mdash;and if you
go to hot climates, keep this in mind&mdash;a particularly sober 
and temperate man, who drank nothing, and could eat 
anything.&nbsp; And he had, it is said, the most extraordinary 
power of managing his men.&nbsp; He was always cool and 
determined; and what he said had to be done, and they knew it; 
but his way with them was so frank and kind, and he was so ready 
to be the foremost in daring and enduring, living worse often 
than his own men, while he was doing every thing for their 
comfort, that there was nothing they would not do for him, as the
event proved&mdash;for if those soldiers had not trusted him for 
life and death, I should not have this grand story to tell.</p>
<p>At last he married a very pretty woman, and got an estate in 
the West Indies, and settled down there; and the chances were ten
to one that no one ever heard of him.&nbsp; However, dim reports 
came to the West Indies of this great empire of Mexico, and of 
all its wonders and wealth, and that stirred up Cortez&rsquo;s 
blood; and nothing would serve him but that leaving wife and 
estate, he must start out again to seek his fortune.</p>
<p>He got a commission from the Governor, such as it was, for 
they were lawless places those Spanish West Indies then; and 
everybody fulfilled a certain Irishman&rsquo;s notion of true 
liberty&mdash;for he did &ldquo;what was <!-- page 215--><a 
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>right in 
the sight of his own eyes, and what <i>was wrong 
too</i>&rdquo;&mdash;and Cortez&rsquo;s commission was to go and 
discover this country, and trade with the people, and make 
Christians of them&mdash;that is, if he could.</p>
<p>So he got together a little army, and sailed away with it for 
the unknown land.&nbsp; He had about one hundred sailors, five 
hundred and fifty soldiers armed with sword and pike, and among 
them thirty-two cross-bow men, and thirteen musketeers.&nbsp; 
Above all, he had sixteen horses, ten heavy guns&mdash;or what 
may be called heavy guns in those times&mdash;about 9-pounders, I
suppose, and four smaller guns; and with that he set out to 
conquer a new world; <i>and he conquered it</i>!</p>
<p>He did not know whither he was going.&nbsp; All he knew was, 
that this wonderful country of Mexico was <i>somewhere</i>, and 
treasures inestimable in it.&nbsp; And one other thing he knew, 
that if mortal man <i>could</i> get there, he <i>would</i>.</p>
<p>He landed at Tabasco&mdash;where Vera Cruz city stands 
now&mdash;fought with the Indians, who ran away at the sight of 
the horses and noise of the cannon; and then made friends with 
them.&nbsp; From them he got presents, and among others, a 
present which was worth more than its weight in gold to him, 
namely, a young slave girl, who had been born near Mexico, and 
knew the language.&nbsp; She was very clever, and very beautiful;
and soon learnt to speak Spanish.&nbsp; She had been a princess 
in her own country, and was sold as a slave by her cruel 
stepmother.&nbsp; They made a Christian of her, and called her 
Dona Marina,&mdash;her Indian name was Malinche,&mdash;and she 
became Cortez&rsquo;s interpreter to the Indians, and his 
secretary.&nbsp; And she loved him and served him as faithfully 
as true woman ever loved man, and saved him <!-- page 216--><a 
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>and his 
from a hundred dangers.&nbsp; And the Spaniards reverence her 
name still; and call a mighty snow mountain after her, Malinche, 
to this day.</p>
<p>After that he marched inland, hearing more and more of the 
wonders of Mexico, till he came at last, after many adventures, 
to a country called Tlascala, up among high mountains.</p>
<p>The men who lived there seem to have been rough honest 
fellows; and brave enough they showed themselves.&nbsp; The 
Mexicans who lived in the plains below never could conquer them, 
though they had been fighting with them for full two hundred 
years.&nbsp; These Tlascalans turned out like men, and fought 
Cortez&mdash;one hundred Indians to one Spaniard they fought for 
four mortal hours; but horses and cannon were too much for them, 
and by evening they were beaten off.&nbsp; They attempted to 
surprise him the same night, and were beaten off again with great
slaughter.&nbsp; Whereon a strange thing happened.</p>
<p>Cortez, through Dona Marina, his interpreter, sent them in 
fair terms.&nbsp; If they would make peace he would forget and 
forgive all; if not, he would kill every man of them, and level 
their city to the ground.&nbsp; Whereon, after more fighting, the
Tlascalans behaved like wise and brave men.&nbsp; They understood
at last that Cortez&rsquo;s point was not Tlascala, but Mexico; 
and the Mexicans were their bitterest enemies; and they had the 
good sense to shake hands with the Spaniards, and make all 
up.&nbsp; And faithful friends they were, and bravely they fought
side by side during all the terrible campaign that 
followed.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Cortez&rsquo;s own men began to lose 
heart.&nbsp; They had had terrible fighting already, and no 
plunder.&nbsp; As for getting to Mexico, it <!-- page 217--><a 
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>was all a 
dream.&nbsp; But Cortez and Dona Marina, this wonderful Indian 
girl, kept them up.&nbsp; No doubt they were in awful 
danger&mdash;a handful of strangers walking blindfold in a vast 
empire, not one foot of ground of which they knew: but Cortez 
knew the further they went the further they must go, for it was 
impossible to go back.&nbsp; So on and on they went; and as they 
went they met ambassadors from Montezuma, the great Emperor of 
Mexico.&nbsp; The very sight of these men confirmed all that they
had heard of the riches of that great empire, for these Indian 
lords came blazing with gold and jewels, and the most magnificent
dresses; and of their power, for at one city which had let Cortez
in peaceably without asking the Emperor&rsquo;s leave, they 
demanded as a fine five and twenty Indian young men and forty 
girls to be offered in sacrifice to their idols.&nbsp; Cortez 
answered that by clapping them in irons, and then sending them 
back to the Emperor, with a message that whether he liked or not,
he was coming to Mexico.</p>
<p>You may call that desperate rashness; but like a good deal of 
rashness, it paid.&nbsp; This great Emperor Montezuma was utterly
panic-stricken.&nbsp; There were old prophecies that white gods 
should come over the sea and destroy him and his empire; and he 
took it into his head that these Spaniards were the white gods, 
and that there was no use resisting them.&nbsp; He had been a 
brave man in his youth, and a great warrior; but he utterly lost 
his head now.&nbsp; He sent magnificent presents to the Spaniards
to buy them off; but that only made them the more keen to come 
on; and come they did, till they saw underneath them the city of 
Mexico, which must have been then one of the wonders of the 
world.</p>
<p><!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>It lay in the midst of a great salt lake, and could 
only be reached from shore by long causeways, beautifully built 
of stone.&nbsp; On this lake were many islands; and what was most
curious of all, floating gardens, covered with all sorts of 
vegetables and flowers.</p>
<p>How big the city was no one will ever know now; but the old 
ruins of it show how magnificent its buildings must have been, 
full of palaces and temples of every kind of carved stone, 
surrounded by flower gardens, while the whole city was full of 
fountains, supplied with pure water brought in pipes from the 
mountains round.&nbsp; I suppose so beautiful a sight as that 
city of Mexico has never been seen since on earth.&nbsp; Only one
ugly feature there was in it&mdash;great pyramids of stone, 
hundreds of them, with idol temples on the top, on each of which 
was kept up a perpetual fire, fed with the fat of human 
beings.</p>
<p>To their surprise the Emperor received them peaceably, came 
out to meet them, gave them such presents, that the common 
soldiers were covered with chains of gold; invited them into the 
city, and gave them a magnificent palace to live in, and endless 
slaves to wait upon them.&nbsp; It sounds all like a fairy tale; 
but it is as true as that you and I are here.</p>
<p>But the cunning emperor had been plotting against them all the
while; and no great blame to him; and at last one of those plots 
came to light; and Cortez made up his mind to take the Emperor 
prisoner.&nbsp; And he did it.&nbsp; Right or wrong, we can 
hardly say now.&nbsp; This Montezuma was a bad, false man, a 
tyrant and a cannibal; but still it looks ugly to seize a man who
is acting as your friend.&nbsp; However, Cortez had courage, in 
the midst of that great city, with hundreds of <!-- page 219--><a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>thousands 
of Indians round him, to go and tell the Emperor that he must 
come with him.&nbsp; And&mdash;so strong is a man when he chooses
to be strong&mdash;the Emperor actually went with Cortez a 
prisoner.</p>
<p>Cortez&mdash;and that was an unworthy action&mdash;put him in 
irons for an hour, to show him that he was master; and then took 
off his irons, and treated him like a king.&nbsp; The poor 
Emperor had all he wanted&mdash;all his wives, and slaves, and 
finery, and eatables, and drinkables; but he was a mere puppet in
the Spaniard&rsquo;s hands; and knew it.&nbsp; And strangely 
enough, not being able to get out of his mind the fancy that 
these Spaniards were gods, or at least, the children of the gods,
he treated them so generously and kindly, that they all loved 
him; he obeyed them in everything; took up a great friendship 
with several; and ended actually by giving them all his treasures
of gold to melt down and part among themselves.&nbsp; As I say, 
it sounds all like a fairy tale, but it happened in this very 
month of November 1519.</p>
<p>But Cortez had been too prosperous not to meet with a 
mishap.&nbsp; Every great man must be tried by trouble; and so 
was Cortez.&nbsp; News came to him that a fresh army of Spaniards
had landed, as he thought at first, to help him.&nbsp; They had 
nine hundred men, eighty of whom were horse soldiers, eighty 
musqueteers, one hundred and fifty cross-bow men, a good train of
heavy guns, ammunition, &amp;c.&nbsp; What was Cortez&rsquo;s 
disgust when he found that the treacherous Governor of Cuba had 
sent them, not to help him, but to take him prisoner as a 
rebel?&nbsp; It was a villainous business got up out of envy of 
Cortez&rsquo;s success, and covetousness of his booty.&nbsp; But 
in the Spanish colonies in those days, so far from home, there 
was very little law; and the governors and <!-- page 220--><a 
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>adventurers
were always quarrelling and fighting with each other.</p>
<p>What did Cortez do? made up his mind as usual to do the 
desperate thing, and marched against Narvaez with only seventy 
men, no guns, and hardly any muskets&mdash;seventy against nine 
hundred.&nbsp; It was fearful odds; but he was forced to leave 
the rest to keep Mexico down.&nbsp; And he armed his men with 
very long lances, tipped at both ends with copper&mdash;for he 
had no iron; with them he hoped to face Narvaez&rsquo;s 
cavalry.</p>
<p>And he did it.&nbsp; Happily on his road he met an old friend 
with one hundred and twenty soldiers, who had been sent off to 
form a colony on the coast.&nbsp; They were as true as steel to 
him.&nbsp; And with that one hundred and ninety he surprised and 
defeated by night Narvaez&rsquo;s splendid little army.&nbsp; And
what is more, after beating them, made such friends with them, 
that he engaged them all next morning to march with him wherever 
he wanted.&nbsp; The man was like a spider&mdash;whoever fell 
into his net, friend or foe, never came out again till he had 
sucked him dry.</p>
<p>Now he hurried back to Mexico, and terribly good reason he 
had; for Alvarado whom he had left in garrison had quarrelled 
with the Mexicans, and set upon them at one of their idol feasts,
and massacred great numbers of their leading men.&nbsp; It was a 
bloody black business, and bitterly the Spaniards paid for 
it.&nbsp; Cortez when he heard it actually lost his temper for 
once, and called his lieutenant-general a madman and a traitor; 
but he could not afford to cashier him, for after all he was the 
best and bravest man he had.&nbsp; But the mischief was 
done.&nbsp; The whole city of Mexico, the whole country round, 
had risen in fury, had driven the Spanish <!-- page 221--><a 
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>garrison 
into the great palace; and worst of all, had burnt the boats, 
which Cortez had left to get off by, if the bridges were burst 
down.&nbsp; So there was Alvarado shut up, exactly like the 
English at Lucknow, with this difference, that the Spaniards 
deserved what they got, and the English, God knows, <i>did 
not</i>.&nbsp; And there was Cortez like another Havelock or 
Colin Campbell marching to deliver them.&nbsp; But he met a very 
different reception.&nbsp; These crafty Mexicans never struck a 
blow.&nbsp; All was as still as the grave.&nbsp; As they came 
over the long causeways and bridges, there was not a canoe upon 
the lake, not an Indian in the floating gardens.&nbsp; As they 
marched through the streets of the glorious city, the streets 
were as empty as a desert.&nbsp; And the Spaniard knew that he 
was walking into a trap, out of which none of them might come out
alive; but their hearts never failed them, and they marched on to
the sound of their bugles, and were answered by joyful salutes of
cannon from the relieved garrison.</p>
<p>The Mexicans had shut up the markets, and no food was to be 
got.&nbsp; Cortez sent to open them.&nbsp; He sent another 
messenger off to the coast to say all was safe, and that he 
should soon conquer the rebels.&nbsp; But here, a cleverer man 
than I must tell the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But scarcely had his messenger been gone half an hour, 
when he returned breathless with terror and covered with 
wounds.&nbsp; &lsquo;The city,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;was all in 
arms! the drawbridges were raised, and the enemy would soon be 
upon them!&nbsp; He spoke truth.&nbsp; It was not long before a 
hoarse sullen sound became audible, like that of the roaring of 
distant waters.&nbsp; It grew louder and louder, till from the 
parapet surrounding the enclosure, the great avenues which led to
it might be <!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>seen dark with the masses of 
warriors, who came rolling on in a confused tide towards the 
fortress.&nbsp; At the same time the terraces and flat roofs in 
the neighbourhood were thronged with combatants, brandishing 
their missiles, who seemed to have risen up as if by magic!&nbsp;
It was a spectacle to appall the stoutest.&nbsp; The Spanish 
forces were crowded into a small compact mass in the palace, and 
the whole army could be assembled at a moment&rsquo;s 
notice.&nbsp; No sooner, therefore, did the trumpet call to arms,
than every soldier was at his post&mdash;the cavalry mounted, the
artillerymen at their guns, and the archers and arquebusiers 
stationed so as to give the assailants a warm reception.&nbsp; On
they came, with the companies, or irregular masses, into which 
the multitude was divided, rushing forward each in its own dense 
column, with many a gay banner displayed, and many a bright gleam
of light reflected from helmet, arrow, and spear head, as they 
were tossed about in their disorderly array.&nbsp; As they drew 
near, the Aztecs set up a hideous yell, which rose far above the 
sound of shell and atabat, and their other rude instruments of 
warlike melody.&nbsp; They followed this by a tempest of 
missiles&mdash;stones, darts, arrows&mdash;which fell thick as 
rain on the besieged.&nbsp; The Spaniards waited till the 
foremost column had arrived, when a general discharge of 
artillery and arquebusses swept the ranks of the assailants, and 
mowed them down by hundreds.&rdquo; <a name="citation222"></a><a 
href="#footnote222" class="citation">[222]</a> . . .</p>
<p>So the fight raged on with fury for two days, while the 
Aztecs, Indians who only fought by day, howled out to the 
wretched Spaniards every night.&nbsp; On the third day Cortez 
brought out the Emperor Montezuma, and commanded him to quiet the
Indians.&nbsp; The unhappy <!-- page 223--><a 
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>man obeyed 
him.&nbsp; He had made up his mind that these Spaniards were the 
white gods, who were to take his kingdom from him, and he 
submitted to them like a sheep to the butcher.&nbsp; He went up 
to a tower in all his royal robes and jewels.&nbsp; At the sight 
the Indians who filled the great square below were all 
hushed&mdash;thousands threw themselves on their faces; and to 
their utter astonishment, he asked them what they meant by 
rebelling.&nbsp; He was no prisoner, he said, but the 
Spaniard&rsquo;s guest and friend.&nbsp; The Spaniards would go 
peaceably, if they would let them.&nbsp; In any case he was the 
Spaniard&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>The Indians answered him by a yell of fury and contempt.&nbsp;
He was a dog&mdash;a woman&mdash;fit only to weave and spin; and 
a volley of stones and arrows flew at him.&nbsp; One struck him 
on the head and dropped him senseless.&nbsp; The Indians set up a
howl of terror; and frightened at what they had done, fled away 
ashamed.</p>
<p>The wretched Emperor refused comfort, food, help, tore the 
bandages from his wounds, and died in two days.&nbsp; He had been
a bad man, a cannibal, and a butcher, blood-thirsty and covetous,
a ravisher of virgins, and a tyrant to his people.&nbsp; But the 
Spaniards had got to love him in spite of all; for a true friend 
he had been to them, and a fearful loss to them just now.&nbsp; 
The battle went on worse than ever.&nbsp; The great idol temple 
commanded the palace, and was covered with Mexican 
warriors.&nbsp; And next day Cortez sent a party to storm 
it.&nbsp; They tried to get up the winding stairs, and were 
driven back three times with fearful loss.&nbsp; Cortez, though 
he had but one hand to fight with, sallied out and cleared the 
pyramid himself, after a fearful hand-to-hand fight of three 
hours, up the winding stairs, along the platforms, <!-- page 
224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
224</span>and at last upon the great square on the top, an acre 
in breadth.&nbsp; Every Mexican was either killed, or hurled down
the sides.&nbsp; The idol, the war god, with its gold disc of 
bleeding hearts smoking before it, was hurled down and the whole 
accursed place set on fire and destroyed.&nbsp; Three hundred 
houses round were also burnt that night; but of what use?</p>
<p>The Spaniards were starving, hemmed in by hundreds of 
thousands.&nbsp; They were like a single wasp inside a 
bee-hive.&nbsp; Let him kill the bees by hundreds, he must be 
killed himself at last.&nbsp; He made up his mind to evacuate the
city, to leave all his conquests behind him.&nbsp; It was a 
terrible disappointment, but it had to be done.</p>
<p>They marched out by night in good order, with all their guns 
and ammunition, and with immense plunder; as much of poor 
Montezuma&rsquo;s treasures as they could carry.&nbsp; The old 
hands took very little; they knew what they were about.&nbsp; The
fresh ones from Narvaez&rsquo;s army loaded themselves with gold 
and jewels, and had to pay dear for them.&nbsp; Cortez, I ought 
to tell you, took good care of Dona Marina.&nbsp; He sent her 
forward under a strong guard of Tlascalans, with all the other 
women.&nbsp; The great street was crossed by many canals.&nbsp; 
Then the causeway across the lake, two miles long, was crossed by
more canals, and at every one of these the Indians had taken away
the bridges.&nbsp; Cortez knew that, and had made a movable 
bridge; but he had only time to make one, and that of course had 
to be taken up at the rear, and carried forward to the front 
every time they crossed a dyke; and that made endless 
delay.&nbsp; As long as they were in the city, however, all went 
well; but the moment they came out upon the lake causeway, out 
thundered the serpent-skin drums from the top of every temple, 
<!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
225</span>the conch shells blew, and out swarmed the whole hive 
of bees, against the one brave wasp who was struggling.&nbsp; The
Spaniards cleared the dyke by cavalry and artillery, and got to 
the first canal, laid down the bridge, and over slowly but 
safely, amid a storm of stones and arrows.&nbsp; They got to the 
second canal, fifteen or twenty feet broad.&nbsp; Why, in 
God&rsquo;s name, was not the bridge brought on?&nbsp; Instead of
the bridge came news from the rear.&nbsp; The weight of the 
artillery had been too great for the bridge, and it was jammed 
fast.&nbsp; And there they were on a narrow dyke fifty feet 
broad, in the midst of the lake, in the dark midnight, with 
countless thousands of Indians, around, before, behind, and the 
lord have mercy on them!</p>
<p>What followed you may guess&mdash;though some of the brave men
who fought there, and who wrote the story themselves&mdash;which 
I have read&mdash;hardly knew.</p>
<p>The cavalry tried to swim their horses over.&nbsp; Some got 
safe, others rolled into the lake.&nbsp; The infantry followed 
pell mell, cut down like sheep by arrows and stones, by the 
terrible glass swords of the Indians, who crowded round their 
canoes.&nbsp; The waggons prest on the men, the guns on them, the
rear on them again, till in a few minutes the canal was choked 
with writhing bodies of men and horses, cannon, gold and treasure
inestimable, over which the survivors scrambled to the further 
bank.&nbsp; Cortez, who was helping the rear forded the gap on 
horseback, and hurried on to find a third and larger canal which 
no one dare cross.&nbsp; But the Indians were not so thick here, 
and plunging into the water they got through as they could.&nbsp;
And woe that night to the soldier who had laden himself with 
Indian treasure.&nbsp; Dragged to the bottom by the weight of 
their plunder, <!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>hundreds died there drowned by that 
very gold to find which they had crossed the seas, and fought so 
many a bloody battle.</p>
<p>What is the use of making a sad story long?&nbsp; They reached
the shore, and sat down like men desperate and foredone in a 
great idol temple.&nbsp; Several of their finest officers, 
three-fourths of their men, were killed and missing, 
three-fourths too of their horses&mdash;all Cortez&rsquo;s 
papers, all their cannon, all their treasure.&nbsp; They had not 
even a musket left.&nbsp; Nothing to face the Indians with but 
twenty-three crippled horses, a few damaged crossbows, and their 
good old swords.&nbsp; Cortez&rsquo;s first question was for poor
Dona Marima, and strange to say she was safe.&nbsp; The trusty 
Tlascalan Indians had brought her through it all.&nbsp; Alvarado 
the lieutenant was safe too.&nbsp; If he had been the cause of 
all that misery, he did his best to make up for it.&nbsp; He 
stayed behind fighting at the last canal till all were over, and 
the Indians closing round him.&nbsp; Then he set his long lance 
in the water, and to the astonishment of both armies, leapt the 
canal clean, while the Indians shouted, &ldquo;This is indeed the
Tonatiah, the child of the Sun.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gap is shown 
now, and it is called to this day, Alvarado&rsquo;s Leap.&nbsp; 
God forgive him! for if he was a cruel man, he was at least a 
brave one!</p>
<p>Cortez sat down, a ruined man, and as he looked round for his 
old comrades, and missed one face after another, he covered his 
face with his hands and cried like a child.</p>
<p>And was he a ruined man?&nbsp; Never less.&nbsp; No man is 
ruined till his pluck is gone.&nbsp; He got his starving and 
shivering men together, and away for the mountains to get back to
the friendly people of Tlascala.&nbsp; The people followed them 
along the hills shouting, &ldquo;Go on! you <!-- page 227--><a 
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>will soon 
find yourselves where you cannot escape.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he went
on&mdash;till he saw what they meant.</p>
<p>Waiting for him in a pass was an army of Indians&mdash;two 
hundred thousand, some writers say&mdash;all fresh and fully 
armed.&nbsp; What could he do?&nbsp; To surrender, was to be 
sacrificed every man to the idols; so he marched on.&nbsp; He had
still twenty horses, and he put ten on each flank.&nbsp; He bade 
his men not strike with their sword but give the point.&nbsp; He 
made a speech to his men.&nbsp; They had beaten the Indians, he 
said, many a time at just as fearful odds.&nbsp; God had brought 
them through so far, God would not desert them, for they were 
fighting on His side against the heathen; and so he went straight
at the vast army of Indians.&nbsp; They were surrounded, 
swallowed up by them for a few minutes.&nbsp; In the course of an
hour the Spaniards had routed them utterly with immense 
slaughter.</p>
<p>Of all the battles I ever read of, this battle of Otumba is 
one of the most miraculous.&nbsp; Some say that Cortez conquered 
Mexico by gunpowder: he had none then, neither cannon nor 
musket.&nbsp; The sword and lance did it all, and they in the 
hands of men worn out with famine, cold, and fatigue, and I had 
said broken-hearted into the bargain.&nbsp; But there was no 
breaking those men&rsquo;s hearts&mdash;what won that battle, 
what won Mexico, was the indomitable pluck of the white man, 
before which the Indian, whether American or Hindoo, never has 
stood, and never will stand to the world&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; The 
Spaniards proved it in America of old, though they were better 
armed than the Indian.&nbsp; But there are those who have proved 
it upon Indians as well armed as themselves.&nbsp; Ay, my 
friends, I should be no Englishman, if while I told this story, I
could help thinking all the while of our brave comrades <!-- page
228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>in
India, who have conquered as Cortez conquered, and against just 
as fearful odds; whose enemies were armed, not with copper arrows
and glass knives, but with European muskets, European cannon, and
most dangerous of all, European discipline.&nbsp; I say Cortez 
did wonders in his time; but I say too that our Indian heroes 
have done more, and done it in a better cause.</p>
<p>And that is the history of the conquest of Mexico.&nbsp; What,
you may ask, is that the end?&nbsp; When we are leaving the 
Spaniards a worn-out and starving handful struggling back for 
refuge to Tlascala, without anything but their old swords; do you
call <i>that</i> a conquest?</p>
<p>Yes, I do; just as I call the getting back to Cawnpore, after 
the relief of Lucknow, the conquest of India.&nbsp; It showed 
which was the better man, Englishman or sepoy, just as the 
retreat from Mexico showed which was the better man, Spaniard or 
Indian.&nbsp; The sepoys were cowed from that day, just as the 
Mexicans were cowed after Otumba.&nbsp; They had fought with all 
possible odds on their side, and been <i>licked</i>; and when men
are once cowed, all the rest is merely a work of time.</p>
<p>So it was with Cortez.&nbsp; He went back to Tlascala.&nbsp; 
He got by mere accident, as we say, a reinforcement of 
Spaniards.&nbsp; He stirred up all the Indian nations round, who 
were weary of the cruel tyranny of the Mexicans; he made large 
boats to navigate the lake, and he marched back upon Mexico the 
next year with about six hundred Spaniards and nine 
cannon&mdash;about half the force which he had had before; but 
with a hundred thousand Indian allies, who, like the sturdy 
Tlascalans, proved as true to him as steel.&nbsp; Truly, if he 
was not a great general, who is?</p>
<p>He marched back, taking city after city as he went, <!-- page 
229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
229</span>and besieged Mexico.&nbsp; It was a long and weary 
siege.&nbsp; The Indians fought like fiends.&nbsp; The causeways 
had to be taken yard by yard; but Cortez, wise by sad experience,
put his cannon into the boats and swept them from the 
water.&nbsp; Then the city had to be taken house by house.&nbsp; 
The Indians drove him back again and again, till they were 
starved to skeletons, and those who used to eat their enemies 
were driven to eat each other.&nbsp; Still they would not give 
in.&nbsp; At last, after many weeks of fighting, it was all 
over.&nbsp; The glorious Mexican empire was crumbled to 
dust.&nbsp; Those proud nobles, who used to fat themselves upon 
the bodies of all the nations round, were reduced to a handful of
starving beggars.&nbsp; The cross of Christ was set up, where the
hearts of human creatures were offered to foul idols, and Mexico 
has been ever since the property of the Spaniards, a Christian 
land.</p>
<p>And what became of Cortez?&nbsp; He died sadly and in 
disgrace.&nbsp; He sowed, and other men reaped.&nbsp; If he was 
cruel and covetous, he was punished for it in this world heavily 
enough.&nbsp; He had many noble qualities though.&nbsp; He was a 
better man than those around him; and one good thing he did, 
which was to sweep off the face of the earth as devilish a set of
tyrants as ever defiled the face of the earth.&nbsp; Give him all
due honour for it, and let him rest in peace.&nbsp; God shall 
judge him and not we.</p>
<p>But take home with you, soldiers all, one lesson from this 
strange story, that while a man can keep his courage and his 
temper, he is not only never really beaten, but no man can tell 
what great things he may not do.</p>
<h3><!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>III.&nbsp; PICTURE GALLERIES.</h3>
<p>Picture-galleries should be the working-man&rsquo;s paradise, 
<a name="citation230"></a><a href="#footnote230" 
class="citation">[230]</a> a garden of pleasure, to which he goes
to refresh his eyes and heart with beautiful shapes and sweet 
colouring, when they are wearied with dull bricks and mortar, and
the ugly colourless things which fill the town, the workshop and 
the factory.&nbsp; For, believe me, there is many a road into our
hearts besides our ears and brains; many a sight, and sound, and 
scent, even, of which we have never <i>thought</i> at all, sinks 
into our memory, and helps to shape our characters; and thus 
children brought up among beautiful sights and sweet sounds will 
most likely show the fruits of their nursing, by thoughtfulness 
and affection, and nobleness of mind, even by the expression of 
the countenance.&nbsp; The poet Wordsworth, talking of training 
up a beautiful country girl, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The floating clouds their state shall 
lend<br />
To her&mdash;for her the willow bend;<br />
Nor shall she fail to see,<br />
Even in the motions of the storm,<br />
<!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
231</span><i>Grace which shall mould the maiden&rsquo;s 
form</i>,<br />
<i>By silent sympathy</i>.<br />
* * * * *<br />
And she shall bend her ear<br />
In many a secret place<br />
Where rivulets dance their wayward round,<br />
<i>And beauty</i>, <i>born of murmuring sound</i>,<br />
<i>Shall pass into her face</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who live in towns should carefully remember this, for 
their own sakes, for their wives&rsquo; sakes, for their 
children&rsquo;s sakes.&nbsp; <i>Never lose an opportunity of 
seeing anything beautiful</i>.&nbsp; Beauty is God&rsquo;s 
handwriting&mdash;a wayside sacrament; welcome it in every fair 
face, every fair sky, every fair flower, and thank <i>Him</i> for
it, who is the fountain of all loveliness, and drink it in, 
simply and earnestly, with all your eyes; it is a charmed 
draught, a cup of blessing.</p>
<p>Therefore I said that picture-galleries should be the 
townsman&rsquo;s paradise of refreshment.&nbsp; Of course, if he 
can get the real air, the real trees, even for an hour, let him 
take it, in God&rsquo;s name; but how many a man who cannot spare
time for a daily country walk, may well slip into the National 
Gallery in Trafalgar Square (or the South Kensington Museum), or 
any other collection of pictures, for ten minutes.&nbsp; 
<i>That</i> garden, at least, flowers as gaily in winter as in 
summer.&nbsp; Those noble faces on the wall are never disfigured 
by grief or passion.&nbsp; There, in the space of a single room, 
the townsman may take his country walk&mdash;a walk beneath 
mountain peaks, blushing sunsets, with broad woodlands spreading 
out below it; a walk through green meadows, under cool mellow 
shades, and overhanging rocks, by rushing brooks, where he 
watches and watches till he seems to <i>hear</i> the foam 
whisper, and to <i>see</i> the fishes leap; and his hard <!-- 
page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
232</span>worn heart wanders out free, beyond the grim city-world
of stone and iron, smoky chimneys, and roaring wheels, into the 
world of beautiful things&mdash;<i>the world which shall be 
hereafter</i>&mdash;ay, which shall be!&nbsp; Believe it, 
toil-worn worker, in spite of thy foul alley, thy crowded 
lodging, thy grimed clothing, thy ill-fed children, thy thin, 
pale wife&mdash;believe it, thou too and thine, will some day 
have <i>your</i> share of beauty.&nbsp; God made you love 
beautiful things only because He intends hereafter to give you 
your fill of them.&nbsp; That pictured face on the wall is 
lovely, but lovelier still may the wife of thy bosom be when she 
meets thee on the resurrection morn!&nbsp; Those baby cherubs in 
the old Italian painting&mdash;how gracefully they flutter and 
sport among the soft clouds, full of rich young life and baby 
joy!&nbsp; Yes, beautiful indeed, but just such a one at this 
very moment is that once pining, deformed child of thine, over 
whose death-cradle thou wast weeping a month ago; now a 
child-angel, whom thou shalt meet again never to part!&nbsp; 
Those landscapes, too, painted by loving, wise old Claude, two 
hundred years ago, are still as fresh as ever.&nbsp; How still 
the meadows are! how pure and free that vault of deep blue 
sky!&nbsp; No wonder that thy worn heart, as thou lookest, sighs 
aloud, &ldquo;Oh that I had wings as a dove, then would I flee 
away and be at rest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah, but gayer meadows and bluer
skies await thee in the <i>world to come</i>&mdash;that 
fairy-land made real&mdash;&ldquo;the new heavens and the new 
earth,&rdquo; which God has prepared for the pure and the loving,
the just and the brave, who have conquered in this sore fight of 
life!</p>
<p>These thoughts may seem all too far-fetched to spring up in a 
man&rsquo;s head from merely looking at pictures; but it is not 
so in practice.&nbsp; See, now, such <!-- page 233--><a 
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>thoughts 
have sprung up in <i>my</i> head; how else did I write them down 
here?&nbsp; And why should not they, and better ones, too, spring
up in your heads, friends?&nbsp; It is delightful to watch in a 
picture-gallery some street-boy enjoying himself; how first 
wonder creeps over his rough face, and then a sweeter, more 
earnest, awestruck look, till his countenance seems to grow 
handsomer and nobler on the spot, and drink in and reflect 
unknowingly, the beauty of the picture he is studying.&nbsp; See 
how some soldier&rsquo;s face will light up before the painting 
which tells him a noble story of bye-gone days.&nbsp; And 
why?&nbsp; Because he feels as if he himself had a share in the 
story at which he looks.&nbsp; They may be noble and glorious men
who are painted there; but they are still <i>men</i> of like 
passions with himself, and his man&rsquo;s heart understands them
and glories in them; and he begins, and rightly, to respect 
himself the more when he finds that he, too, has a fellow-feeling
with noble men and noble deeds.</p>
<p>I say, pictures raise blessed thoughts in me&mdash;why not in 
you, my brothers?&nbsp; Your hearts are fresh, thoughtful, 
kindly; you only want to have these pictures explained to you, 
that you may know <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> they are beautiful, 
and what feelings they ought to stir in your minds.&nbsp; Look at
the portraits on the walls, and let me explain one or two.&nbsp; 
Often the portraits are simpler than large pictures, and they 
speak of real men and women who once lived on this earth of 
ours&mdash;generally of remarkable and noble men&mdash;and man 
should be always interesting to man.</p>
<h3><!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>IV.&nbsp; A PORTRAIT IN THE NATIONAL
GALLERY.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Any one who goes to the National Gallery in Trafalgar 
Square, may see two large and beautiful pictures&mdash;the nearer
of the two labelled &lsquo;Titian,&rsquo; representing Bacchus 
leaping from a car drawn by leopards.&nbsp; The other, labelled 
&lsquo;Francia,&rsquo; representing the Holy Family seated on a 
sort of throne, with several figures arranged below&mdash;one of 
them a man pierced with arrows.&nbsp; Between these two, low 
down, hangs a small picture, about two feet square, containing 
only the portrait of an old man, in a white cap and robe, and 
labelled on the picture itself, &lsquo;<i>Joannes 
Bellinus</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now this old man is a very ancient 
friend of mine, and has comforted my heart, and preached me a 
sharp sermon, too, many a time.&nbsp; I never enter that gallery 
without having five minutes&rsquo; converse with him; and yet he 
has been dead at least three hundred years, and, what is more, I 
don&rsquo;t even know his name.&nbsp; But what more do I know of 
a man by knowing his name?&nbsp; Whether the man&rsquo;s name be 
Brown, or whether he has as many names and titles as a Spanish 
grandee, what does that tell me about the <i>man</i>?&mdash;the 
spirit and character of the man&mdash;what the man will say when 
he is asked&mdash;what the man will do when he is stirred up to 
action?&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s name is part of his clothes; his 
shell; his husk.&nbsp; Change his <!-- page 235--><a 
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>name and 
all his titles, you don&rsquo;t change <i>him</i>&mdash;&lsquo;a 
man&rsquo;s a man for a&rsquo; that,&rsquo; as Burns says; and a 
goose a goose.&nbsp; Other men gave him his name; but his heart 
and his spirit&mdash;his love and his hatred&mdash;his wisdom and
his folly&mdash;his power to do well and ill; those God and 
himself gave him.&nbsp; I must know those, and then I know the 
<i>man</i>.&nbsp; Let us see what we can make out from the 
picture itself about the man whom it represents.&nbsp; In the 
first place, we may see by his dress that he was in his day the 
Doge (or chief magistrate) of Venice&mdash;the island city, the 
queen of the seas.&nbsp; So we may guess that he had many a 
stirring time of it, and many a delicate game to play among those
tyrannous and covetous old merchant-princes who had elected him; 
who were keeping up their own power at the expense of 
everyone&rsquo;s liberty, by spies and nameless accusers, and 
secret councils, tortures, and prisons, whose horrors no one ever
returned to describe.&nbsp; Nay, we may guess just the very men 
with whom he had to deal&mdash;the very battles he may have seen 
fought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all these are <i>circumstances</i>&mdash;things 
which <i>stand round</i> the man (as the word means), and not the
whole man himself&mdash;not the character and heart of the man: 
that we must get from the portrait; and if the portrait is a 
truly noble portrait we shall get it.&nbsp; If it is a merely 
vulgar picture, we shall get the man&rsquo;s dress and shape of 
his face, but little or no expression: if it is a <i>pathetic</i>
portrait, or picture of passion, we shall get one particular 
temporary expression of his face&mdash;perhaps joy, sorrow, 
anger, disgust&mdash;but still one which may have passed any 
moment, and left his face quite different; but if the picture is 
one of the noblest kind, we shall read the man&rsquo;s whole 
character there; just all <!-- page 236--><a 
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>his 
strength and weakness, his kindliness or his sternness, his 
thoughtfulness or his carelessness, written there once and for 
ever;&mdash;what he would be, though all the world passed away; 
what his immortal and eternal soul will be, unless God or the 
devil changed his heart, to all eternity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may see at once that this man has been very 
handsome; but it is a peculiar sort of beauty.&nbsp; How delicate
and graceful all the lines in his face are!&mdash;he is a 
gentleman of God&rsquo;s own making, and not of the 
tailor&rsquo;s making.&nbsp; He is such a gentleman as I have 
seen among working men and nine-shilling-a-week labourers, often 
and often; his nobleness is in his heart&mdash;it is God&rsquo;s 
gift, therefore it shows in his noble looking face.&nbsp; No 
matter whether he were poor or rich; all the rags in the world, 
all the finery in the world, could not have made him look like a 
snob or a swell.&nbsp; He was a thoughtful man, too; no one with 
such a forehead could have been a trifler: a kindly man, too, and
honest&mdash;one that may have played merrily enough with his 
grandchildren, and put his hand in his purse for many a widow and
orphan.&nbsp; Look what a bright, clear, straightforward, gentle 
look he has, almost a smile; but he has gone through too many sad
hours to smile much: he is a man of many sorrows, like all true 
and noble rulers; and, like a high mountain-side, his face bears 
the furrows of many storms.&nbsp; He has had a stern life of it, 
with the cares of a great nation on his shoulders.&nbsp; He has 
seen that in this world there is no rest for those who live like 
true men: you may see it by the wrinkles in his brow, and the 
sharp-cut furrows in his cheeks, and those firm-set, determined 
lips.&nbsp; His eyes almost show the marks of many noble 
tears,&mdash;tears such as good men shed over their 
nation&rsquo;s <!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>sins; but that, too, is past 
now.&nbsp; He has found out his path, and he will keep it; and he
has no misgiving now about what God would have him do, or about 
the reward which God has laid up for the brave and just; and that
is what makes his forehead so clear and bright, while his very 
teeth are clenched with calm determination.&nbsp; And by the look
of those high cheek bones, and that large square jaw, he is a 
strong-willed man enough, and not one to be easily turned aside 
from his purpose by any man alive, or by any woman either, or by 
his own passions and tempers.&nbsp; One fault of character, I 
think, he may perhaps have had much trouble with&mdash;I mean 
bitterness and contemptuousness.&nbsp; His lips are very thin; he
may have sneered many a time, when he was younger, at the follies
of the world which that great, lofty, thoughtful brain and clear 
eye of his told him were follies; but he seems to have got past 
that too.&nbsp; Such is the man&rsquo;s character: a noble, 
simple, commanding old man, who has conquered many hard things, 
and, hardest of all, has conquered himself, and now is waiting 
calm for his everlasting rest.&nbsp; God send us all the 
same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now consider the deep insight of old John Bellini, who 
could see all this, and put it down there for us with pencil and 
paint.&nbsp; No doubt there was something in Bellini&rsquo;s own 
character which made him especially best able to paint such a 
man; for we always understand those who are most like ourselves; 
and therefore you may tell pretty nearly a painter&rsquo;s own 
character by seeing what sort of subjects he paints, and what his
style of painting is.&nbsp; And a noble, simple, brave, godly man
was old John Bellini, who never lost his head, though princes 
were flattering him and snobs following him with shouts and <!-- 
page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
238</span>blessings for his noble pictures of the Venetian 
victories, as if he had been a man sent from God Himself, as 
indeed he was&mdash;all great painters are; for who but God makes
beauty?&nbsp; Who gives the loving heart, and the clear eye, and 
the graceful taste to see beauty and to copy it, and to set forth
on canvas, or in stone, the noble deeds of patriots dying for 
their country?&nbsp; To paint truly patriotic pictures well, a 
man must have his heart in his work&mdash;he must be a true 
patriot himself, as John Bellini was (if I mistake not, he had 
fought for his country himself in more than one shrewd 
fight).&nbsp; And what makes men patriots, or artists, or 
anything noble at all, but the spirit of the living God?&nbsp; 
Those great pictures of Bellini&rsquo;s are no more; they were 
burnt a few years afterwards, with the magnificent national hall 
in which they hung; but the spirit of them is not passed 
away.&nbsp; Even now, Venice, Bellini&rsquo;s beloved 
mother-land, is rising, new-born, from long weary years of 
Austrian slavery, and trying to be free and great once more; and 
young Italian hearts are lighting up with the thoughts of her old
fleets and her old victories, her merchants and her statesmen, 
whom John Bellini drew.&nbsp; Venice sinned, and fell; and sorely
has she paid for her sins, through two hundred years of shame, 
and profligacy, and slavery.&nbsp; And she has broken the 
oppressor&rsquo;s yoke.&nbsp; God send her a new life!&nbsp; May 
she learn by her ancient sins!&nbsp; May she learn by her ancient
glories!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will forgive me for forgetting my picture to talk 
of such things.&nbsp; But we must return.&nbsp; Look back at what
I said about the old portrait&mdash;the clear, calm, victorious 
character of the old man&rsquo;s face, and see how all the rest 
of the picture agrees with it, in a complete harmony.&nbsp; The 
dress, the scenery, the light and shade, <!-- page 239--><a 
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>the general
&lsquo;tone&rsquo; of colour should all agree with the character 
of the face&mdash;all help to bring our minds into that state in 
which we may best feel and sympathise with the human beings 
painted.&nbsp; Now here, because the face is calm and grand, the 
colour and the outlines are quiet and grand likewise.&nbsp; How 
different these colours are from that glorious &lsquo;Holy 
Family&rsquo; of Francia&rsquo;s, next to it on the right; or 
from that equally glorious &lsquo;Bacchus and Ariadne&rsquo; of 
Titian&rsquo;s, on the left!&nbsp; Yet all three are right, each 
for its own subject.&nbsp; Here you have no brilliant reds, no 
rich warm browns; no luscious greens.&nbsp; The white robe and 
cap give us the thought of purity and simplicity; the very golden
embroidery on them, which marks his rank, is carefully kept back 
from being too gaudy.&nbsp; Everything is <i>sober</i> here; and 
the lines of the dress, how simple they all are&mdash;no rich 
curves, no fluttering drapery.&nbsp; They would be quite stiff if
it were not for that waving line of round tassels in front, which
break the extreme straightness and heaviness of the splendid 
robe; and all pointing upwards towards that solemn, thin, calm 
face, with its high white cap, rising like the peak of a snow 
mountain against the dark, deep, boundless blue sky beyond.&nbsp;
That is a grand thought of Bellini&rsquo;s.&nbsp; You do not see 
the man&rsquo;s hands; he does not want them now, his work is 
done.&nbsp; You see no landscape behind&mdash;no buildings.&nbsp;
All earth&rsquo;s ways and sights are nothing to him now; there 
is nothing but the old man and the sky&mdash;nothing between him 
and the heaven now, and he knows it and is glad.&nbsp; A few 
months more, and those way-worn features shall have crumbled to 
their dust, and that strong, meek spirit shall be in the abyss of
eternity, before the God from whence it came.</p>
<p><!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>&ldquo;So says John Bellini, with art more cunning than
words.&nbsp; And if this paper shall make one of you look at that
little picture with fresh interest, and raise one strong and 
solemn longing in you to die the death of the righteous, and let 
your last end be like his who is painted there&mdash;then I shall
rejoice in the only payment I desire to get, for this my 
afternoon&rsquo;s writing.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>V.&nbsp; THE BRITISH MUSEUM.</h3>
<p>Nature is infinitely more wonderful than the highest art; and 
in the commonest hedgeside leaf lies a mystery and beauty greater
than that of the greatest picture, the noblest statue&mdash;as 
infinitely greater as God&rsquo;s work is infinitely greater than
man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But to those who have no leisure to study 
nature in the green fields (and there are now-a-days too many 
such, though the time may come when all will have that blessing),
to such I say, go to the British Museum, Bloomsbury Square; there
at least, if you cannot go to nature&rsquo;s wonders, some of 
nature&rsquo;s wonders are brought to you.</p>
<p>The British Museum is my glory and joy; because it is one of 
the only places which is free to English citizens as 
such&mdash;where the poor and the rich may meet together, and 
before those works of God&rsquo;s Spirit, &ldquo;who is no 
respecter of persons,&rdquo; feel that &ldquo;the Lord is the 
maker of them all.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the British Museum and the 
National Gallery, the Englishman may say, &ldquo;Whatever my coat
or my purse, I am an Englishman, and therefore I have a right 
here.&nbsp; I can glory in these noble halls, as if they were my 
own house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>English commerce, the joint enterprise and industry of the 
poor sailor as well as the rich merchant, brought home these 
treasures from foreign lands; and those <!-- page 242--><a 
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>glorious 
statues&mdash;though it was the wealth and taste of English 
noblemen and gentlemen (who in that proved themselves truly noble
and gentle) who placed them here, yet it was the genius of 
English artists&mdash;men at once above and below all 
ranks&mdash;men who have worked their way up, not by money or 
birth, but by worth and genius, which taught the noble and 
wealthy the value of those antiques, and which proclaimed their 
beauty to the world.&nbsp; The British Museum is a truly 
equalising place, in the deepest and most spiritual sense.&nbsp; 
And it gives the lie, too, to that common slander, &ldquo;that 
the English are not worthy of free admission to valuable and 
curious collections, because they have such a trick of seeing 
with their fingers; such a trick of scribbling their names, of 
defiling and disfiguring works of art.&nbsp; On the Continent it 
may do, but you cannot trust the English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This has been, like many other untruths, so often repeated, 
that people now take it for granted; but I believe that it is 
utterly groundless, and I say so on the experience of the British
Museum and the National Gallery.&nbsp; In the only two cases, I 
believe, in which injury has been done to anything in either 
place, the destroyers were neither working-men, nor even poor 
reckless heathen street-boys, but persons who had received what 
is too often miscalled &ldquo;a liberal education.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
But <i>national property will always be respected</i>, because 
all will be content, while they feel that they have their rights,
and all will be careful while they feel that they have a share in
the treasure.</p>
<p>Go to the British Museum in Easter week, and see there 
hundreds of thousands, of every rank and age, wandering past 
sculptures and paintings, which would be <!-- page 243--><a 
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>ruined by a
blow&mdash;past jewels and curiosities, any one of which would 
buy many a poor soul there a month&rsquo;s food and 
lodging&mdash;only protected by a pane of glass, if by that; and 
then see not a thing disfigured&mdash;much less stolen.&nbsp; 
Everywhere order, care, attention, honest pride in their 
country&rsquo;s wealth and science; earnest reverence for the 
mighty works of God, and of the God-inspired.&nbsp; I say, the 
people of England prove themselves worthy of free admission to 
all works of art, and it is therefore the duty of those who can 
to help them to that free admission.</p>
<p>What a noble, and righteous, and truly brotherly plan it would
be, if all classes would join to form a free National Gallery of 
Art and Science, which might combine the advantages of the 
present Polytechnic, Society of Arts, and British Institution, 
gratis. <a name="citation243"></a><a href="#footnote243" 
class="citation">[243]</a>&nbsp; Manufacturers and men of science
might send thither specimens of their new inventions.&nbsp; The 
rich might send, for a few months in the year&mdash;as they do 
now to the British Institution&mdash;ancient and modern pictures,
and not only pictures, but all sorts of curious works of art and 
nature, which are now hidden in their drawing-rooms and 
libraries.&nbsp; There might be free liberty to copy any object, 
on the copyist&rsquo;s name and residence being registered.&nbsp;
And surely artists and men of science might be found, with enough
of the spirit of patriotism and love, to explain gratuitously to 
all comers, whatever their rank or class, the wonders of the 
Museum.&nbsp; I really believe that if once <i>the spirit of 
brotherhood</i> got abroad among us; if men once saw that here 
was a vast means of educating, and softening and <!-- page 
244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
244</span>uniting those who have no leisure for study, and few 
means of enjoyment, except the gin-shop and Cremorne Gardens; if 
they could but once feel that here was a project, equally blessed
for rich and poor, the money for it would be at once forthcoming 
from many a rich man, who is longing to do good, if he could only
be shown the way; and from many a poor journeyman, who would 
gladly contribute his mite to a truly national museum.&nbsp; All 
that is wanted is the spirit of self-sacrifice, patriotism and 
brotherly love&mdash;which God alone can give&mdash;which I 
believe He is giving more and more in these very days.</p>
<p>I never felt this more strongly than one day, as I was looking
in at the windows of a splendid curiosity-shop in Oxford Street, 
at a case of humming-birds.&nbsp; I was gloating over the beauty 
of those feathered jewels, and then wondering what was the 
meaning, what was the use of it all? why those exquisite little 
creatures should have been hidden for ages, in all their 
splendours of ruby, and emerald, and gold in the South American 
forests, breeding and fluttering and dying, that some dozen out 
of all those millions might be brought over here to astonish the 
eyes of men.&nbsp; And as I asked myself, why were all these 
boundless varieties, these treasures of unseen beauty, created? 
my brain grew dizzy between pleasure and thought; and, as always 
happens when one is most innocently delighted, &ldquo;I turned to
share the joy,&rdquo; as Wordsworth says; and next to me stood a 
huge, brawny coal-heaver, in his shovel hat, and white stockings 
and high-lows, gazing at the humming-birds as earnestly as 
myself.&nbsp; As I turned he turned, and I saw a bright manly 
face, with a broad, soot-grimmed forehead, from under which a 
pair of keen flashing eyes <!-- page 245--><a 
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>gleamed 
wondering, smiling sympathy into mine.&nbsp; In that moment we 
felt ourselves friends.&nbsp; If we had been Frenchmen, we 
should, I suppose, have rushed into each other&rsquo;s arms and 
&ldquo;fraternised&rdquo; upon the spot.&nbsp; As we were a pair 
of dumb, awkward Englishmen, we only gazed a half-minute, staring
into each other&rsquo;s eyes, with a delightful feeling of 
understanding each other, and then burst out both at once with, 
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that beautiful?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, that
is!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then both turned back again, to stare at our
humming-birds.</p>
<p>I never felt more thoroughly than at that minute (though, 
thank God, I had often felt it before) that all men were 
<i>brothers</i>; that this was not a mere political doctrine, but
a blessed God-ordained fact; that the party-walls of rank and 
fashion and money were but a paper prison of our own making, 
which we might break through any moment by a single hearty and 
kindly feeling; that the one spirit of God was given without 
respect of persons; that the beautiful things were beautiful 
alike to the coal-heaver and the parson; and that before the 
wondrous works of God and of God&rsquo;s inspired genius, the 
rich and the poor might meet together, and feel that whatever the
coat or the creed may be, &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s a man for a&rsquo;
that,&rdquo; and one Lord the maker of them all.</p>
<p>For, believe me, my friends, rich and poor&mdash;and I beseech
you to think deeply over this great truth&mdash;that men will

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
